1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,260
Till now, you have learned a lot of concepts.

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,000
You know many Linux commands we learn about scripting, etc.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,440
We also learned that you can have multiple users in a Linux environment, and these users

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,560
can run programs and processes as well as execute different commands, etc.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,480
In fact, you can have multiple users on other operating systems as well.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,560
Like Windows or macOS.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,280
So this multi-user environment is actually very common on all operating systems.

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,480
So each user has its own environment where it works and executes stuff.

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,040
And as you know, as a user you can configure your space, your account basically on an operating

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,240
system by setting different preferences.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,960
Maybe you want a certain graphic user interface layout.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,120
You want the font to be bigger, you want different colors.

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,000
You can configure all of that.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,440
Maybe you also want to have a different shell program and not the default bash program.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,720
You want to configure a default editor when opening files.

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,240
Or maybe you also want to set a web browser which is going to be a default for opening

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
websites.

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,760
You can configure all of that on an operating system, whether it's Linux or Windows or whatever.

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,040
So when you make changes in the operating system configuration and set preferences, of

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,880
course you don't want your configuration to influence other users on the system.

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,120
Because they might have their own preferences for all of this.

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,120
So these environments, the user environments and the configuration and settings should

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,040
be separate from each other.

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,280
So how does an operating system keep track of these users and their environments?

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,160
So where does it store all the information about how each user has configured their space?

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,480
Operating system stores this information in what's called environment variables, which

27
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,240
are basically pieces of information defined by key value pairs.

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,280
In the bash scripting you learn about variables.

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,120
We have a name of the variable and the value that name references.

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,320
That's exactly how environment variables are defined.

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,000
But these environment variables are available for the whole environment, not just for one

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,920
specific script.

33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,160
And the keys or names of these environment variables, by standard, are defined with all

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,800
capital letters.

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,520
For example, each user has a set of environment variables that define the user's environment

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
settings.

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,160
For example, user variable that has a value of the currently logged in user.

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,760
Or home variable that points to the current user's home directory.

39
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,560
And you also have variables that define user's preferences, like editor, which is a default

40
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,560
file editor that's used when you open a file.

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,520
Or shell, which is user's default shell program.

42
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:17,040
And as we learned by default, Linux configures bash as a default shell program.

43
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,280
But a user can change that to another shell program, like ZShell, for example, right?

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,000
So the value of shell environment variable will point to the path of ZShell instead.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,840
So as you see, a user can change these environment variable values.

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,360
So they are set by the operating system, but you can change them.

47
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,880
That's why we call them variables.

48
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,680
They have dynamic values that can be changed.

49
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:53,560
So let's see how you can access these variables in your system.

50
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,280
We have a command for displaying all the environment variables that the operating system sets for

51
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,440
that user's environment.

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:13,400
And that command is print and if I execute this, you can see a list of environment variables,

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,920
a bunch of them that system has set for us.

54
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,560
We can also open them using less program.

55
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,680
As we learned, we can basically view them like this.

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,120
And as you see there are a bunch of different environment variables, you don't have to understand

57
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,880
and know each one.

58
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,620
But here are some of them that I already mentioned.

59
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,800
We have a shell variable that points to the default shell program, which is set to bash.

60
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,520
We have the home environment variable that points to my user's home directory as well

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,420
as user name.

62
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:54,360
We have a language that I have configured for my account, which is English.

63
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,520
We also have the Linux user and so on.

64
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,880
We can also access individual environment variables using print and then the name of

65
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,320
the variable like user, for example.

66
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,680
And we get the value of that environment variable.

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,760
So this way we can check what is the current value of a specific environment variable.

68
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:26,800
If we have multiple environment variables that have similar name, we can print all them

69
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,680
by using grep command like this.

70
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,840
And there you go.

71
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,840
So this is basically how we can print environment variables using print and command.

72
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,600
However, the environment variables can also be used by Linux programs or commands by referencing

73
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:51,920
them with a syntax that we already learned in bash scripting, which is dollar sign and

74
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,560
variable name.

75
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,040
And as I said, we can use that variable reference in different commands.

76
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:06,280
For example, we can do echo and then variable name, and it will give us the value.

77
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,600
In the same way, we can use environment variables or can reference them in bash scripts, just

78
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:20,080
like you would a normal variable that you define inside the bash script.

79
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,600
As I said, operating system creates these environment variables to store information

80
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,640
about the environment.

81
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,800
But this is just one use case of environment variables in an operating system, because

82
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,680
they have many more usages.

83
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,800
For example, we can also create our own environment variables in addition to what system already

84
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,360
provides us with.

85
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,200
Now why would we want to do that?

86
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,760
What is the use case of creating our own environment variables?

87
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,480
Consider a program we want to run on an operating system.

88
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,920
Let's say I want to run a Java application or a Python application on a Linux server

89
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,320
with my user.

90
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,120
And that application needs to connect to a database or an external API like Google Maps,

91
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,240
for example.

92
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,840
Such external services like external databases, APIs, whatever, they usually need some kind

93
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,480
of authentication so that not everybody can connect to it.

94
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,880
So the application that I created that I want to run on the server will need username and

95
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,080
password to access the database.

96
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,520
Or it will need some kind of a secret token to connect to the Google Maps API so that

97
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,640
the service knows this is that application that it can trust.

98
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:50,000
Now how can we tell that application in a secure way what these secret values are?

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,720
What the credentials for a database or the secret token for the API is?

100
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,880
Because we can't just write these values in the code of the application and check that

101
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:07,160
into the code repository because then other people may easily see that in the repository

102
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,960
plus it will be in plain text.

103
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,520
That's not secure so we can't put this information inside the code.

104
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,160
So how do we store this sensitive data in a secure way but also in a way that the application

105
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,760
can access them when it runs on the server?

106
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:33,720
And one very common way to do this is by setting such data as environment variables so that

107
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,040
application can then read the values of those environment variables.

108
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
How does it work?

109
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,960
We basically create environment variables like database underscore username or database

110
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,920
underscore password and again that's a standard naming convention for environment variables,

111
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,120
all caps and underscore for separating the words.

112
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,520
So we set this environment variables and by creating these environment variables in Linux

113
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:09,480
on a server for example we make them available in our environment or in our user's environment.

114
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,640
And this means they become accessible for all the applications and processes that we

115
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,880
run in that environment.

116
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,080
Now you're probably wondering how does the application access those environment variables?

117
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,440
How can it actually read?

118
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,840
What is the code for that?

119
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:33,400
Well note that every programming language has a syntax or a library that allows it to

120
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:39,080
access or read these variables from the environment where it's running.

121
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,340
So every programming language basically supports that.

122
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,880
Now the environment variables we create for the application aren't only for storing sensitive

123
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,480
data but also for making the application more flexible.

124
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,680
What do I mean by that?

125
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,960
Our application will probably run in different servers.

126
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:04,000
We might have a development server which is our development environment for testing the

127
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,760
application maybe in development stage.

128
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,040
Then we may have a testing server and then we may have the production server and each

129
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,280
of these environments like develop, test and production will have their own database.

130
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,520
So we'll have a database for testing maybe and database for production.

131
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,920
So production database will have its own credentials and external services or external APIs.

132
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,040
They will also have production, access token and testing access token.

133
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,380
That's a basic standard when developing applications.

134
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,600
So instead of hard coding these values in the application using environment variables

135
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,160
you can dynamically set different values for your application and run it in different

136
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,840
environments without changing the code.

137
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:01,200
So when your application runs in a development environment you can give it credentials to

138
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
the development database.

139
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,480
When it runs in production you can give it or you can pass in environment variables

140
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,760
for production database and production API keys.

141
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,160
And this makes your application much more flexible while also storing all this sensitive

142
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:25,840
data in a secure way on that server where the application is running so no one can access

143
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
it.

144
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,920
It's like providing parameters to your application just like we provided parameters to our Bash

145
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,960
script.

146
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,720
So as you see environment variables are a very important concept in all operating systems

147
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,200
and it works pretty much the same whether you're Linux or Windows or macOS.

148
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,720
Now let's actually see how to create our own environment variables.

149
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,820
And this works pretty much the same on all Linux distributions so nothing specific to

150
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,120
Ubuntu here.

151
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:05,080
So first of all to create an environment variable like db username for example which is defined

152
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,360
a variable name again all caps and underscore and a value.

153
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:17,520
The value is the actual username in the database this could be called a db user or my app user

154
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
whatever.

155
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:25,920
However for this to be set or to be interpreted by the system as environment variable we need

156
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,320
to do something like export.

157
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:36,520
So we are exporting a variable as an environment variable and this is what makes it different

158
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,040
to standard variables that we defined in the Bash script for example because standard

159
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,440
variables are only available in that script.

160
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,600
Environment variables are available in the whole environment and for that we need to

161
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,400
do export and then variable.

162
00:12:52,400 --> 00:13:00,440
We can also export db password for example let's say it's a secret value that nobody

163
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
should know.

164
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:10,280
It's also very common to set not so sensitive data like database name or URL also as environment

165
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:17,200
variables instead of hard coding that into the code and as I said because this way we

166
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,960
can run our application development production testing environments without hard coding these

167
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,680
values inside the code.

168
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:34,320
So db name because the database name and database URL will actually be different for production

169
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,680
database and for development or testing database.

170
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:48,120
So this sets environment variables in our Linux environment and now if I do print and

171
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:58,960
filter all my environment variables that have db in it using the grep command there

172
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:05,480
you go print and print environment variables and three of them that we defined here are

173
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,880
on the list.

174
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,040
Again if we want to use that in other Linux commands for example if we want to use that

175
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:19,160
in a bash script whatever we can access them using dollar sign and then name of that variable

176
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:26,880
like this and again because these are variables we can also change the values of those environment

177
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,000
variables once we define them.

178
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,880
So maybe we renamed the database so we can set db name to new db name whatever that is.

179
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:49,400
And we can also unset or basically remove the environment variable from the environment

180
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:57,680
using the unset command and name of the variable like this.

181
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,680
Again execute print and there you go.

182
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,800
So once we set those environment variables that application should read basically or

183
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:16,520
access to be able to connect to a database we can now run the application in this prepared

184
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:23,240
environment where we have created the variables and the application will be able to access

185
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,640
those values.

186
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,120
So right here you would run your Java application or Python application or whatever it is.

187
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,680
However there is one interesting point here when working with environment variables or

188
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,480
when setting them.

189
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:49,840
So I'm going to close this terminal and open it again and do print and filter for our db

190
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:56,120
values and you see all those environment variables that we set are actually gone.

191
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,720
They're not here anymore.

192
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,600
So basically and that is a very important concept to know is that whenever we set environment

193
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,960
variables using the export command on a command line interface they are only available in

194
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,440
this current session basically right.

195
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,840
So in the environment of this specific session and once we close that terminal or even if

196
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:28,960
we just open a new window in this terminal in the session that environment variable will

197
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,720
not be accessible.

198
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,560
So these are not permanent environment variables that we can set using the export command.

199
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:44,320
So how do we set environment variables permanently so that we don't lose them whenever we close

200
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
the session.

201
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:52,520
Well for that there is a file in each user's home directory.

202
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:59,160
This is home directory for my current user and the file is called dot it's a hidden file

203
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,240
bash RC.

204
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,880
So basically there is a file in the user's home directory created by or auto generated

205
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,520
for the shell program that your user is using by default.

206
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,160
In our case we're using bash program that's why it's bash RC if you're using for example

207
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,000
Z shell instead this will be Z shell RC.

208
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,680
So basically whatever your shell program name is it will have this RC file that holds the

209
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,480
environment variable specific to your user.

210
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,320
So if we open this you see a bunch of code here.

211
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,040
So whenever we want to permanently add variables that will be available in all the terminals

212
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:55,960
in all the sessions of our user we need to add them in this file or in this RC file of

213
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:02,960
whatever shell program is configured as the default shell for your user.

214
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:16,560
So right here at the end of the file we're going to do export DB username and then password

215
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,720
some secrets value doesn't matter.

216
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,120
Let's also set DB name and there you go.

217
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,680
Now we can close this and save the changes.

218
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,560
Now there is one more thing we need to do here because if we now do print and we don't

219
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,440
see the values yet.

220
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,520
So basically we have added those environment variables in our bash RC file however the

221
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,640
system doesn't know about the change yet.

222
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,280
So we are kind of reloading the system to take the changes from that file.

223
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:04,480
And for that we do source bash RC.

224
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,840
So we're telling the program hey we changed something in that bash RC file please apply

225
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,160
those changes.

226
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,960
And now if I do print and again there you go we have our environment variable values.

227
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:25,840
And now if I close the terminal and open it again and do print and we have the values

228
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,120
available.

229
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:33,720
Now whatever application or program you run in whichever session these environment variables

230
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:41,760
will always be accessible for all those programs.

231
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,080
Now in our examples we created environment variables for our user right.

232
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,320
So we configured environment for one specific user.

233
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,840
What if we want to set an environment variable for all the users on the system.

234
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:04,800
Well in addition to the user specific bash RC file or shell programs configuration file

235
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:12,480
in each user's home directory we also have a system wide environment variables file which

236
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:21,160
is located in slash ETC folder which is a directory where system configuration is stored

237
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,480
and the file is called environment.

238
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,440
If I open this file you see that we have one environment variable already configured here

239
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,140
called path.

240
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:38,760
So this is a globally set environment variable called path that has the same value for all

241
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,920
the users on the system.

242
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,080
So what is this path variable.

243
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,800
It's basically a list of directories with executable or binary files in them.

244
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,960
That's why you see the binary folders at the end of each path.

245
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:03,400
So we have user local S beam user local beam etc and each directory is separated by a column

246
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:10,760
so this is basically just a list and the way it works is that whenever we execute a command

247
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:17,480
or a program on a command line interface the system checks all of these locations configured

248
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:24,320
in the path variable to find that commands or programs binary file and execute it from

249
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
there.

250
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:32,720
And that means whenever we install a new software like Java or Python or Node.js whatever the

251
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,820
binary files of this software will get added into one of those locations and that's why

252
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:46,320
we're able to execute Java, Python etc commands on a command line interface because the system

253
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,920
knows where the binaries of that command is.

254
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:58,520
And let's actually leave this file without saving any changes column Q exclamation mark

255
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,640
we're just quitting.

256
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,160
So basically path is a very important variable because thanks to that path variable we don't

257
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:14,800
have to do this every time we want to use LS command for example instead we can just

258
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,080
do LS.

259
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:24,960
So whenever we do LS basically it looks inside the path variables list of directories for

260
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:32,800
the LS commands binary file and that means if we create an executable program and provide

261
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:40,000
path variable with its location so if we add the location here as well we can run command

262
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,600
to execute that program directly like this from anywhere in our file system and since

263
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,160
path is a global environment variable set for all the users it will be available for

264
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:00,080
all the users on the system.

265
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:07,240
And it will be fun to try out this one example so let's see how we can add our custom command

266
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:16,840
or program to the executable path so let's create a very simple welcome script and we

267
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:28,200
know the syntax already we have our shebang at the beginning and then we have let's just

268
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:40,680
add echo line here welcome to devops bootcamp and user environment variable and you see

269
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,680
that we don't have the syntax highlighting here this nice shell or bash syntax highlighting

270
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:55,000
because I created the file without extension just welcome without .sh so that's why but

271
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,560
it does matter because just a simple echo example and now as you remember we need to

272
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:12,360
make this welcome file executable so we add permission for all users for executing this

273
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:23,320
welcome script like this and now we can add this executable files location to path variable

274
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:31,080
either globally as we saw previously or and that's actually also an interesting use case

275
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:37,320
we can add this location to the path only for our user how can we do that instead of changing that

276
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,800
in the global environments environment file we're going to change that in our bash rc file

277
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:52,600
here we actually don't have a path variable so how do we do that simply by doing path equals

278
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,320
and then we can reference the existing path variable which is available for all the users

279
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:08,040
and we're gonna append slash home slash nano this is a directory where our welcome command or welcome

280
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:17,400
program is located so we always need the location to the directory so again we are taking the the

281
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,400
existing path variables value which is the list of all the directories and then we are

282
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:30,760
appending our custom scripts location at the end and we're setting that back as a path variable

283
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,960
for the system and we don't write export here because the variable path already exists and is

284
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:45,000
already exported we're just changing its value here so if I save this and quit and let's do source

285
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:52,120
bash rc and now let's actually move to somewhere else where we don't have

286
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:02,840
welcome script or welcome command and if I do welcome there you go welcome to devops bootcamp

287
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,720
and the linux user that we referenced from environment variable so again path or the

288
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:17,640
the purpose of path is that instead of me having to provide the full the absolute location

289
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:25,000
or path to my program like this I can just go wherever I want in my file system in the command

290
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,040
line and I can type in just the name of the program and it will find it in one of those

291
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:38,360
directories configured in the path so these are some of the use cases and some of the really

292
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:45,640
important usages of environment variables on an operating system and we're going to be working

293
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:52,760
with them throughout our bootcamp so you will see plenty of realistic use cases and examples

294
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:59,160
where we set and use environment variables for different applications
