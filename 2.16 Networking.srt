00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Cool, we learned so far lots of awesome, very interesting concepts in operating systems

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,760
and specifically in Linux.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,600
And I hope by now you already feel very knowledgeable in this area.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,600
There is, however, a very important concept still missing in order to feel like a pro

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,120
in Linux, and that is networking.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,640
How does computer networks work?

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,420
How do computers connect to the Internet?

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,460
What is an IP address and a port or a DNS and so on?

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,660
And we will learn all of this in this lecture where I will explain all the main concepts

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,300
step by step with examples.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,780
So let's get started.

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,700
First of all, imagine your home network or your house where different devices like your

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,620
computer and laptop and phone are connected to that network.

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,340
Such a network is called a LAN or local area network.

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,180
So LAN is a network of a bunch of devices connected together in one physical location.

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,580
This can be as small as a private house LAN or LAN of a huge office building or a school

17
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,500
campus with hundreds of devices.

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:23,420
And each device on this network is identified by a unique IP address where IP stands for

19
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,060
Internet Protocol.

20
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,340
So devices can talk to each other on the network using this unique IP address.

21
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,460
For example, if your computer wants to send a printer something to print, it must know

22
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,100
the printer's IP address and send the information there.

23
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,180
This is an example of an IP address 172.16.0.0.

24
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,820
So IP address is basically a 32-bit value.

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,620
One bit is essentially a value of one or zero.

26
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,780
Now we don't need to go into details here, but it's important to know that an IP address

27
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,700
or IPv4 address is composed of 32 bits.

28
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,540
So basically 32 ones or zeros here.

29
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,100
And what are those dots between them?

30
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,580
So every eight bits are grouped into an octet.

31
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,220
And each octet can be represented as a decimal number that we humans can read.

32
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,660
Like this octet here represents 172.

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,420
This one represents 16 and so on.

34
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:43,540
So octet with all zeros, so eight zeros is just a zero, and an octet with all ones, so

35
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,580
eight ones is a number 255.

36
00:02:48,580 --> 00:03:02,580
That means that IP address value can be any combination between 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255.

37
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,300
So that's how IP address is made up.

38
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,940
But how do devices know each other's IP addresses or how can they send things to each other?

39
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,740
So that is a task of a special device on a local area network called a switch.

40
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:25,060
So switch sits within the LAN and knows all the IP addresses of all the devices and therefore

41
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,980
helps them communicate with each other within that local area network.

42
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,620
Great, so your laptop can talk to a phone or a printer in LAN using a switch.

43
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,820
But what if you want to talk to a server or some other device which is not in your LAN?

44
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,660
Like you want to open a Facebook website on your laptop so you need to connect to and

45
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:53,580
talk to a Facebook server which is obviously outside your LAN or essentially any website

46
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,660
which is hosted on a server outside your LAN.

47
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,420
Does switch help there too?

48
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,420
No.

49
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:06,140
For connecting to outside devices there is another special device in a LAN called a router.

50
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,700
Router is a network device that sits between the local area network and the outside network

51
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,300
which is also called a wide area network or WAN.

52
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:23,100
So the router connects devices on local area network and wide area network which means

53
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,060
the router connects you to the internet.

54
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,700
Back to our Facebook example, if you want to open Facebook app on your phone, your phone

55
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,540
will send a request to the router then router will send that request to Facebook server

56
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,900
over the internet and the IP address of the router is called a gateway.

57
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:49,980
So when you hear the term router and network gateway are basically the same thing.

58
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:57,060
Now the question is when a device in LAN sends a request to another device, how does it know

59
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:04,660
whether that other device is within the LAN or it's outside the LAN in the wide area network?

60
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,340
Well this is decided based on the IP address of the target device.

61
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,140
Remember as I said that every device on LAN has a unique IP address?

62
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,260
Well these IP addresses aren't random.

63
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:24,860
They all belong to the same range of IP addresses to identify devices in the same network.

64
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:33,140
And that IP address range is represented by a concept called subnet or subnetwork.

65
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,580
This is how an IP address range for a LAN can look like.

66
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:44,860
So the first part here is the IP address and that's the starting point of the IP address

67
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,180
range so that's the first IP address in the range and the second one is what's called

68
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,260
a subnet mask.

69
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:59,420
So subnet basically sets the range and it defines that whatever IP address of a device

70
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:13,660
starts with 192.168.0 so whenever an IP address starts with this it belongs to the LAN.

71
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:28,340
If we change the subnet mask value from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.0.0 this will define an IP address

72
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:39,380
range that starts with 192.168 so all the IP addresses that starts with these two numbers

73
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,340
belong to the same LAN.

74
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:52,900
So as you see the value 255 fixates the IP block or octet and the value of zero means

75
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,780
a free range.

76
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:04,980
Why 255.0 because as you learned each IP decimal block can have values from zero to 255.

77
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,660
So anything within that range.

78
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:15,260
So basically subnet defines how many bits in the IP address are fixed making the rest

79
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,060
of them flexible.

80
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:27,380
So 255.255.0.0 means that half of it or 16 bits are fixed in the IP address this on

81
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:34,900
the other hand means that third of all the bits or 24 bits are fixed in the IP address.

82
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:43,820
So again when we're using this as a subnet mask it means that those first three octets

83
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:51,300
or decimal values cannot change right so the IP addresses of this LAN here will be between

84
00:07:51,300 --> 00:08:03,220
192.168.0 so the first three cannot change they are fixated and the last one can change

85
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,340
and it could be all the way up to 255.

86
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:12,700
So your IP addresses will be within those ranges and right here we have only half of

87
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:24,540
it fixated so your IP addresses of this LAN will be from this IP address to 255.255.

88
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:31,180
So within this range that's how it works and as we said this subnet mask number basically

89
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,780
dictates how many bits in this 32-bit IP address are fixed.

90
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,580
So based on this logic there is actually a shorthand way of writing this which is also

91
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,760
called a cider block and is written like this.

92
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:55,300
So the same IP address as we have here slash 16 or slash 24 where 16 and 24 represent the

93
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,940
number of bits in the IP address range that are fixed.

94
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,900
Just to recap with subnet and a starting IP address we have a range of IP addresses that

95
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,100
are available in the LAN.

96
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:17,660
So every device in that local area network will get an IP address from that range.

97
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,780
So when we send a request to an IP address within our LAN the request will go to the

98
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,900
switch and it will forward it to the device within the LAN.

99
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,740
If the IP address is external it will go to the internet through the router and that means

100
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:39,300
any device on your network will need three pieces of data to communicate with other devices

101
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:47,260
both within its own network and to the outside networks devices and this is the IP address,

102
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,300
subnet and gateway.

103
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,940
Now we said that internally in a LAN we have an IP address range that a network administrator

104
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:07,380
of a company or school or in case of your own house your internet provider chooses and

105
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,100
that each device will get a unique IP address from that range.

106
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,020
And suppose a device in our LAN is talking to a device in another LAN.

107
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:23,300
Now how do we make sure not every network administrator selects the same range and that

108
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:30,620
the IP addresses in our LAN don't overlap or aren't the same as someone else's LAN?

109
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:37,820
Well the way it works is that the IP addresses of devices that belong to a LAN are not visible

110
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
to the outside network or internet.

111
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,740
So when you send a request to Facebook from your laptop your laptop's IP address from

112
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:52,260
the LAN range does not arrive at Facebook server instead it's replaced by the IP address

113
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:58,700
of the router and this functionality of router is called a network address translation or

114
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,940
net.

115
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,180
So basically when a laptop sends a request it goes to the router because router is the

116
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:10,980
connection to the outside network right to internet and router will then request that

117
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:17,460
on the device's behalf from internet and the response will then be sent back to the

118
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,340
device and that is a very important concept and has two main advantages.

119
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,740
One of them is security and protection of devices on the LAN because your IP address

120
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,940
isn't directly exposed and no one can talk to it directly and the second one is that

121
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:40,060
we can reuse IP address ranges multiple times without conflicting with each other.

122
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:47,180
So two huge companies can have the same IP address range within their own local area

123
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,460
network and they will basically not know about each other so there will be no conflict and

124
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:59,420
this is very efficient because there are a limited number of IP addresses you get from

125
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:07,140
the IPv4 address range which is as we saw four zeros and four two hundred fifty fives

126
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,180
and sure there are lots of combinations between them however there are also lots and lots

127
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:19,100
of devices in the world that need IP addresses.

128
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,340
Now what if an outside device wants to talk to your LAN directly?

129
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,380
Like you have a server that runs your application so you want to be able to accept requests

130
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,060
from devices outside your LAN.

131
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,780
Well by default this kind of communication will not be allowed because of a firewall.

132
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,540
So what is a firewall?

133
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:45,380
Firewall is a set of rules that protect a network from unauthorized access and you can explicitly

134
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:52,260
define what kind of communication you want to allow to your network using firewall rules.

135
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,860
So how does that work?

136
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,900
You define which device on your network with a specific IP address should be accessible.

137
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:06,140
You can also define which other devices or what IP addresses specifically can access

138
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,820
your server or you can say I allow any device on the internet to talk to my server.

139
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,980
And this is usually the case when you're running a web application because you want everyone

140
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,540
to be able to access your application.

141
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,420
So for most servers that are running some applications you will need to configure firewall

142
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,700
rules to manage the access configuration.

143
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:33,660
Now there is one more important thing that you always define in a firewall rule and that

144
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:40,940
is which ports are accessible on the server or generally on the device that you want to

145
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,660
allow access to.

146
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,740
So what is a port?

147
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:53,740
Every device has a set of ports and ports are like doors to the same building.

148
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:01,100
You unlock some doors so the guests or requests can enter and you keep others locked so no

149
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,700
one can enter there.

150
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:10,900
Or you unlock them only for specific guests like a specific IP address that can enter

151
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,860
the door so to say.

152
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:19,180
So with firewall configuration you define which doors of the building or your server in this

153
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,500
case you want to unlock and for which guests or for what requests.

154
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:32,380
And different applications and programs that run on the server will start or listen on

155
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:38,700
different ports meaning you can access that application on the device only on that specific

156
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
port.

157
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:46,380
And to keep this all standardized there are default or standard ports for many applications.

158
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:53,660
For example most web applications start on port 80 so they are accessible on that port

159
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,860
from the browser when you request the application.

160
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:03,580
That means when you type facebook.com or google.com in the browser by default this request goes

161
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:09,260
to a machine where Facebook or Google application is running on port 80.

162
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:17,060
So on those machines the firewall was configured to unlock the port 80 to accept browser requests.

163
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:23,220
Other applications like databases also have standard ports like a MySQL database is usually

164
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:32,620
accessible on port 3306, Postgresql on port 5432 and so on.

165
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:39,220
So for every application you need a port to communicate and each port is unique on a device.

166
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,500
So you can't have two applications listening on the same port.

167
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,180
If you try to start the second application on the same port you will get an error which

168
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,980
says port already in use.

169
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:57,580
So the firewall configuration allows a specific combination of device IP address and port

170
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,300
to be accessed.

171
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,540
So firewall is like a guard that is standing in front of the building and checks and verifies

172
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,580
who can enter which door.

173
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:14,300
And that configuration is also called port forwarding configuration.

174
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,660
Now when talking about networking there is one more concept that is essential to understand

175
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:27,380
and probably something you've heard very often and that is a DNS or the main name service.

176
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,260
DNS is basically the thing that the whole networking relies on.

177
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,740
So let's see exactly what a DNS is.

178
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:41,220
We know that every computer on the network is uniquely identified by its IP address.

179
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,700
And we saw that every device can talk to any other device using its IP address.

180
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:52,500
But when you visit Facebook application you type in the IP address in the browser or when

181
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,620
you visit any other website you never just type an IP address, right?

182
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,820
Why is that?

183
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:07,140
Because Facebook.com application runs on many computers which each have their own IP address.

184
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:12,220
A website of your favorite local restaurant is available on a specific computer with an

185
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,580
IP address.

186
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:21,060
So every single application that is running on a machine is accessible by an IP address.

187
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:26,340
So why do we use names of the application instead of the IP addresses?

188
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,880
Simply because we are not computers.

189
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,140
Humans remember words and names better than IP addresses and numbers.

190
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:40,060
So to make using the web easier for humans the concept of mapping the IP addresses to

191
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,440
names was introduced.

192
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,940
So we access every application by typing the name.

193
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:52,420
But the network as we saw doesn't understand the names, it understands numbers and IP addresses.

194
00:17:52,420 --> 00:18:00,100
So under the hood that name gets translated into the actual IP address where that application

195
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,100
is running which then your computer can send the request to.

196
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,960
And the service that does this translation is DNS.

197
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,020
So using DNS we can give a unique name to any IP address.

198
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,300
So you can think of a DNS as an address book or yellow pages of internet.

199
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,220
But considering there are so many websites and applications in the world and new ones

200
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,900
being added daily and so many servers in this world connected to the internet.

201
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,820
How does DNS manage so many addresses and their names?

202
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:39,260
DNS uses a simple policy of dividing all these names into different domains or groups.

203
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,340
Main names follow a hierarchical structure.

204
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:50,380
There are around 13 root domains across the globe with names from A to M and under each

205
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:56,460
root domain you have a hierarchy of what's called top level domains or TLDs.

206
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,020
There are six original and most common top level domains and each domain has a specific

207
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,540
purpose.

208
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,300
We have .mil which is for military applications.

209
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,860
Then we have .edu or EDU.

210
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,900
This is for educational institutions and their websites.

211
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,500
Then we have .com which is more general purpose and usually used for businesses because .com

212
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,460
stands for commercial.

213
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,860
Then we have .org which is for non-profit organizations usually.

214
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,260
The next one is .net.

215
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,820
Originally for networking technologies like internet service providers or any other infrastructure

216
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,500
provider companies.

217
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:44,020
But today it's more general purpose and can be used by all types of businesses.

218
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,620
And finally we have .gov which is for government.

219
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:53,300
Apart from these original top level domains there are geographical domains which were

220
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,900
added later.

221
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,420
These are domains for each country.

222
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,340
This is used to also regulate domain names for companies that are registered in that

223
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
country.

224
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:12,260
Examples would be .de for Germany, .us for US, .uk, .fr for France etc.

225
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:17,540
This makes sense if your website is in the local language and your visitors are local

226
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,780
from that country like local restaurants, shops etc.

227
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:29,580
And finally a bunch of other domains were also added like .bis, .int, .dev etc.

228
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,980
So basically whenever someone creates a website they can buy a domain name that belongs to

229
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:42,660
one of these domains like mywebsite.com or mywebsite.uk and you may buy it for a year

230
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,340
and if you don't need it anymore someone else can buy the domain name later.

231
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,980
Now who actually manages these names or who can sell those domain names to you or keep

232
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:58,020
track of which ones are already taken and which ones are still available?

233
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,700
Or who decides how these domains are grouped or divided?

234
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,860
Well this is all regulated by a dedicated organization called the Internet Corporation

235
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:17,380
for Assigned Names and Numbers, ICANN, which basically manages all these domain name spaces

236
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:23,740
and it also authorizes domain name registers through which domain names may be registered

237
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,220
and reassigned.

238
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,500
Obviously you don't have to remember this organization's name but I think it's interesting

239
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,020
information to know that there is actually a dedicated organization that manages all

240
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,540
these domain names.

241
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:43,460
So as I said every domain name actually belongs to this root and one of its top level domains

242
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,380
or geographic domains.

243
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:51,100
Now suppose I want to create my own website and let people visit it like TechWorld with

244
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,820
NANA website.

245
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,180
Just I select the top level domain that I want for it, in my case dot com and create

246
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,420
a domain for TechWorld with NANA dot com.

247
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,940
Now let's say I have three servers with three different applications which all belong to

248
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,940
my company.

249
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,060
So they are in the TechWorld with NANA dot com domain.

250
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:17,540
I can assign each one its own domain name using a concept called subdomains like bootcamp

251
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,340
dot TechWorld with NANA dot com or workshops dot TechWorld with NANA dot com and then courses

252
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,820
dot TechWorld with NANA dot com.

253
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:32,140
And many companies and many organizations actually use these subdomains for different

254
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,260
applications that all belong to that organization.

255
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:42,260
So each application may run on its own dedicated server and each server that has its own IP

256
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,740
address will now have a full domain name with which you can access it.

257
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,900
There's also a fully qualified domain name which will be courses dot TechWorld with NANA

258
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,820
dot com dot where dot at the end is for root domain.

259
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,580
But we don't use the fully qualified domain names, it works without dot at the end as

260
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,580
well.

261
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,820
Great, so we understand what DNS is but how does your computer actually use the DNS service

262
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,660
to map the domain name to an IP address?

263
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:17,660
Your computer has a DNS client pre-installed, so when you open a browser and type in Facebook

264
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:24,140
dot com your operating system will make a DNS query asking DNS to resolve that Facebook

265
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,660
dot com address or find the IP address that maps to Facebook dot com.

266
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:35,340
The DNS request first goes to the recursive name server which is typically operated by

267
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,660
your internet service provider and your cursive name server might have the IP address already

268
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:48,620
stored but if it doesn't it will go to one of the 13 root servers which manage requests

269
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,940
for top level domains.

270
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,980
These root servers are redundantly available all over the world so that you get your response

271
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,980
quickly.

272
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:04,020
The root server will then look at the address and see dot com and it sends a response back

273
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,100
to the resolver saying I don't know what the address of Facebook dot com is but here's

274
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,740
the address of the dot coms domain server which you can ask.

275
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,500
The resolver then asks the dot com server, hey can you give me the IP address of facebook

276
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,780
dot com?

277
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:26,420
The dot com server sends a response, I don't know the IP address of facebook dot com but

278
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:33,940
here is a list of the IP addresses of the authoritative name servers for dot com domain.

279
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,980
They will know facebook dot coms IP address.

280
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:43,540
So finally resolver chooses the IP address of one of the authoritative name servers

281
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,580
from the list asking for facebook dot coms IP address.

282
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:54,100
And this time the name server responds with the actual IP address of facebook dot com.

283
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,820
So now your computer can send the request to facebook's IP address.

284
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,700
Now imagine this process happens every time you visit a website for the first time but

285
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:09,500
to save time in the future and make things more efficient both the recursive name server

286
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:16,260
and your computer will cache the DNS entries for a while so that the next time you want

287
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:23,500
to visit the same address it won't have to go through this whole process.

288
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:29,260
At this point you know all the essentials of networking and if you want to see the networking

289
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:35,820
information on your computer there are various useful programs or commands for that.

290
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:42,500
For example with if config command you can get your computer's IP address, subnet mask,

291
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:48,100
gateway address which is again the router IP address and a bunch of other information

292
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,600
about your network.

293
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,180
There is also a very useful command called netstat that shows you what active connections

294
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,660
you have on your machine.

295
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,740
Active connection means which applications are actively listening on their specific ports.

296
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,980
A typical use case can be even application on your server is not accessible and you're

297
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:14,260
getting connection refused error for example you can check with this command whether that

298
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:20,140
application is actively running or not and on which port it's listening.

299
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,980
You can also check current running processes and programs and their information including

300
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:32,260
on which ports they're running as well as how much computer resources they are consuming

301
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,620
using a psox command.

302
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:41,120
Using an nslookup command you can get an IP address of any domain name.

303
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,820
This command also displays the IP address of the DNS server your computer uses or you can

304
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:54,460
also do a reverse check with nslookup command to show what the main name is attached to a

305
00:26:54,540 --> 00:27:00,860
specific IP address and last but not least a very simple command ping that basically

306
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,260
checks whether a service or application is accessible.

307
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:11,540
So you connect to or ping an IP address or the main name of an application and it shows

308
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,620
you whether that address is accessible or not.

309
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,540
You can use all these commands to basically troubleshoot your network when something is

310
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:24,420
not working and you can also use switches or different parameters for all these commands

311
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:31,100
to enhance the command capabilities and display more information or display information in

312
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,980
a different format for example.

313
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:40,260
For that you can reference the documentation of all these commands.

314
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:45,580
So as a DevOps engineer you don't need to be a networking expert obviously but with

315
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:51,180
this foundational knowledge you will understand a lot of things much better in your DevOps

316
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,540
tasks and it will make your learning path much easier.

317
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:01,740
And we will use some of these commands and many of these concepts throughout the bootcamp

318
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,140
so you will see some real use cases for that.
