1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
In the next video, we're going to install a virtual box hypervisor and then we're going

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,420
to set up a Linux Ubuntu virtual machine on it.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,600
So if you have a Windows machine or Mac OS like I do, you can follow this tutorial to

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,680
set up a Linux virtual machine.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,880
Now before we start installing the virtual box tool, I want to mention that in case you

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,120
have any issues during the installation, I actually added a section where I go through

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,840
some of the common issues that you may encounter during the installation, especially depending

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,340
on which operating system you're using an installing virtual box on and you may find

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,780
a solution there.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,080
In this section, I want to go through some of the common issues that you may encounter

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,160
during the installation and I want to give you some options or alternatives to actually

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,000
fix those issues or install or create your virtual machine in a different way.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,400
First of all, I want to start by saying that the main goal of the lecture is not to teach

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,440
you how to use virtual box or generally how the virtual machine installation works because

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,480
you won't actually be doing that so often as a DevOps engineer, so you don't need that

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,360
knowledge so much.

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,240
The main goal is to learn Linux.

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,960
So having a Linux machine available is actually the main focus of this lecture so you can

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,560
follow along the rest of the demos in this specific module.

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,160
Throughout the rest of the bootcamp, we're actually going to be working with cloud platforms

21
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,320
and creating virtual servers there, so you won't be working with virtual machines locally

22
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,800
after this module.

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,080
And this means if installing a virtual machine does not work or you have any issues during

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,360
this process, when you're following the demo that I'm showing you, don't spend too much

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
time on that.

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,320
You can either spin up a simple virtual machine on a cloud platform, which I actually teach

27
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,360
in the cloud basics module, and I'm going to link exactly the module and video number

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,680
below this video so you can find it directly, or if you don't want to pay the cloud platform

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,240
yet, and if you want to actually wait until we get to that module, you can spin up a virtual

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:29,200
machine for free on this online platform, and you will have a Linux Ubuntu machine available

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,600
through the browser.

32
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,040
And this is actually going to be the easiest option.

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,480
I will leave the link to this online platform below the video as well, so you will find

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,240
all this information there.

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,680
So basically find the easiest way to get a Linux machine and you are going to be good

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
to go.

37
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,920
If you already have a Linux distribution, and if you're working on a Linux computer

38
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,320
or laptop, you don't need to install any VM at all, you can skip this part, and you

39
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,440
can do the demos in the following videos with your Linux operating system.

40
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,200
I also want to mention that this is actually a very common issue with any technology or

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:13,800
tool, and it's a common problem in IT that we all have to deal with called version compatibility.

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,720
So in this case, you guys have different operating systems, different versions of operating systems,

43
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,840
different hardware resources, etc., so there is no one solution fits all.

44
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,000
So you may all have to do this in different ways.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,640
And VirtualBox is actually the most standard tool across all operating systems, and that's

46
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,680
why I selected it, but it doesn't work for some specific cases.

47
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,680
For example, the latest Mac OS version is not supported yet by VirtualBox.

48
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,000
They will fix that in the future, but for now it's not working.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,720
So that's again a typical version compatibility issue where the one tool hasn't caught up

50
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,200
with another tool yet.

51
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,880
So for those cases, I want to suggest some alternatives to follow the demos without getting

52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,200
stuck here and interrupting your learning process.

53
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,120
So here are a couple of suggestions.

54
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,760
If you're on a Windows machine and the demo that I'm showing you is not working for you,

55
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,160
first of all, please make sure you have virtualization enabled in BIOS.

56
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,160
I will leave the resources below where you can see how that works for different Windows

57
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,560
versions.

58
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,040
And VirtualBox is actually the best VM tool for Windows, however, you will need some resources

59
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,360
on your computer.

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,960
And if you don't have enough CPU, enough RAM to allocate to your VM, then I suggest

61
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,520
you go with a less resource intensive option.

62
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,520
For example, you can install WSL, which is Windows subsystem for Linux, which will require

63
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,280
way less resources.

64
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,520
And again, I will leave the links below this video for guides of how to install WSL.

65
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,680
If you're on Mac, especially if you have the latest version of Mac OS operating system,

66
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,920
or if you have the latest Mac hardware with M1 chip, the VirtualBox installation is not

67
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,280
going to work for you.

68
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,440
So I suggest two easy and better alternatives.

69
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:27,440
The first one is installing UTM, that's a virtual machine tool for Mac OS, and another

70
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,600
one which is called Parallels.

71
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,280
They're both very easy to install and get started with.

72
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,640
And again, I will leave all the links that show you how to install each one of them below

73
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,960
this video.

74
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:47,240
Another issue with VirtualBox that some students also encountered is installing the extension

75
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,860
pack that basically lets you copy and paste between host and the virtual machine.

76
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,200
So that part is not working, or you're getting an error during the installation, please check

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,880
out the resource that I'm going to leave below this video for step by step guide of

78
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,560
how to fix that.

79
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,560
The final notes on resources.

80
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,120
As I also mentioned, many of you have different hardware resources.

81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,080
Generally, the more RAM and CPU you allocate to your virtual machine, the faster and more

82
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,880
performant it is.

83
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:31,320
So if you do have enough resources, then increase RAM and CPU for your VM when you're creating

84
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,840
it.

85
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,600
But if you're working with limited resources, for example, Windows operating system itself

86
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,840
requires more resources than Linux, for example.

87
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,080
So Windows machines are usually slower because they already use up a lot of the resources.

88
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,280
So in that case, you may have some resource limitation.

89
00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:00,360
As I suggested, in that case, please use some less resource intensive tool like WSL instead

90
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,520
of the VirtualBox or the online platform where you can spin up a virtual machine without

91
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,680
having to install it locally.

92
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,880
So overall, as I said, pick the easiest option and continue with the demos.

93
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,600
I usually say that if something is not working, you should play around with it.

94
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,040
This way you learn the tool better.

95
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,000
But local virtual machine installation is not that important of a use case.

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,800
So you can skip it and go with some easy option like the online virtual machine.

97
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,360
So you can proceed with your learning.

98
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,840
So first of all, we're going to need to download VirtualBox.

99
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,320
So in Google search box, I'm just going to type in VirtualBox download.

100
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,920
And we have this Oracle VirtualBox page.

101
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,440
And here you have the latest package for different operating systems.

102
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,200
So we have VirtualBox for Windows.

103
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,560
So if you're on Windows, now load this one.

104
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,960
I have Mac OS and that's the package I'm going to download.

105
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,920
So I'm going to click on install file.

106
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,000
And since it's over 100 megabytes, it may take some time to install.

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Great.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,700
Once that's done, I'm just going to click on that.

109
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,860
And this should present us with VirtualBox installation window.

110
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,540
And to install it, I'm just going to double click on it.

111
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,020
And we get this installation wizard.

112
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,620
So we're just going to click continue without changing anything.

113
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,620
Continue.

114
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,540
It tells you how much resources it's going to need on your computer.

115
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:40,500
We're going to do install and allow installing.

116
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,060
And installation was successful.

117
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:51,140
And that means we have VirtualBox now installed locally so we can use it.

118
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:57,020
Now if you're on Mac, actually, there is one thing that you may need to configure for

119
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,140
the VirtualBox installation to succeed.

120
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:07,620
So if your installment actually failed in the security and privacy settings here, you

121
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:17,100
may have a prompt here that says allow Oracle America basically to access your computer resources.

122
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,180
So you will need to allow that and then do the installation again.

123
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,220
So now I'm going to search for VirtualBox on my machine and you see that it is installed.

124
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,220
We have that application.

125
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,700
I'm going to click on it.

126
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,260
And we should see this VirtualBox manager window.

127
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,380
So basically we have this graphical user interface for VirtualBox to create the virtual

128
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:44,140
machines and to manage them, basically to change any settings on them, to remove them,

129
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,900
to create them, etc.

130
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,580
Which of course makes it easy to work with virtual machines.

131
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:55,100
Now one prerequisite that I want to mention here when you're creating virtual machines

132
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,660
on your computer is the prerequisite of resources.

133
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:08,020
So you are going to need at least four gigabytes of RAM on your computer because otherwise

134
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,020
you may have some problems creating virtual machine.

135
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:18,140
Because remember that we are sharing the hardware resources of the computer now among two computers.

136
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,340
So your operating system, your host operating system, in this case Mac, is already using

137
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:29,260
up some hardware resources and on top of that we're going to create another machine which

138
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,700
is going to require its own hardware resources.

139
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,500
And four gigabytes of RAM I would say is really the lowest limit.

140
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,820
So make sure you have that on your computer.

141
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,820
Great.

142
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:50,260
So next step is to actually prepare the environment for the virtual machine to be created.

143
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:57,060
And for that we're going to do new and we're going to set all this up.

144
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:05,820
And since we're creating a Linux virtual machine here let's call it Linux Ubuntu.

145
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,820
And you see that it basically intelligently detected from the name that I gave it that

146
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:21,840
we want Linux type of virtual machine here and version is Ubuntu 64 bit.

147
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,680
And this is basically where virtual machine will create the folders for the virtual machine

148
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,000
configuration.

149
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,400
And there is an option here to add an operating system ISO image to install on the virtual

150
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,520
machine.

151
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,920
We will leave this empty for now and upload the disk image after the VM is created in

152
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,640
virtual box.

153
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,200
And here is basically where we assign the virtual machine hardware resources.

154
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,360
So this is going to be a virtual RAM that our Linux VM will get.

155
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,000
And basically you can adjust this.

156
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,960
But again know that this shows you the entire RAM size that you have on your computer.

157
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,920
And now you have to share some of that with the VM.

158
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm going to increase the allocated memory here to 4096 megabytes which is around four

159
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,760
gigabytes of memory which I'm going to give to my Linux VM.

160
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,480
It is also possible to allocate CPU resources to the virtual machine.

161
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,600
If you have enough computing power on your local computer you should actually allocate

162
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,440
four gigabytes of RAM and two CPUs to the virtual machine to avoid any performance issues.

163
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,640
And that is what I will do and then click next.

164
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,080
Here we will create a new virtual hard disk and we can adjust the virtual hard disk or

165
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,280
hard drive space size assigned to our VM.

166
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,280
The default option I have here is 25 gigabytes.

167
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:59,680
Although it is possible to allocate as little as 10 gigabytes I actually recommend allocating

168
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,600
at least 20 or even 30 gigabytes of storage if you have enough space on your host machine.

169
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,560
There is an additional storage option shown by the checkbox here next to preallocate full

170
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,960
size hard disk.

171
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,200
If you leave this box unchecked the hypervisor will actually intelligently decide how much

172
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,400
storage your virtual machine needs and basically dynamically set it.

173
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,840
So if it doesn't need 10 gigabytes of storage it's going to allocate less.

174
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,600
If it needs more storage it's going to request more storage from the host operating system.

175
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:41,520
If you select preallocated full size disk then it will be allocated the entire 25 gigabytes

176
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
and that's it.

177
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:49,280
We will leave the checkbox unmarked to set the storage to be dynamic and then click next.

178
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,880
The summary page will show you the settings you have chosen and you can click finish to

179
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,520
create the virtual machine.

180
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
Awesome.

181
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:03,560
So you see that we have Linux Ubuntu operating system and we have all the settings here,

182
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,960
the storage size, et cetera displayed.

183
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:16,520
Now what we did is actually prepare an environment for Linux virtual image to run on, right?

184
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:23,920
So this is like a container so to say where we're going to install Linux operating system.

185
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,000
So we need to actually install Linux operating system on this virtual machine and for that

186
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,640
we're going to need a Linux operating system image.

187
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,680
Just like you would take your laptop, your physical laptop and if you wanted to install

188
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,920
Linux Ubuntu or any other distribution on it you would have this Linux operating system

189
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,240
image on a USB or a disk or whatever and you would attach that to your laptop and you would

190
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,800
install that from that USB, right?

191
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:00,520
The same way we need a Linux image that we're going to install into our VM and those operating

192
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:15,120
system images usually have .iso extension ISO and if I type in Ubuntu downloads on

193
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,920
this website here ubuntu.com slash download you actually have all Ubuntu installation

194
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,160
images and here I want to mention that virtual box and Ubuntu they're both free or generally

195
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,040
Linux is free so basically we don't need any type of license we can just download them

196
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,360
and use them for free which is actually pretty amazing because if you want to use Windows

197
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,360
for example if you want to install Windows operating system in your virtual machine then

198
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,880
you would have to have a Windows license, right?

199
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:54,280
So in our case we're going to need Ubuntu desktop because I want to have a graphical user interface

200
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:03,240
in my Ubuntu installation so I'm going to click on it and on this page we're seeing the Ubuntu

201
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:10,080
versions that we can download we have the latest one which is 22.10 and we have a slightly

202
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:17,920
older version 22.4 which has the letters LTS at the end so LTS basically stands for long

203
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,160
term support and this means that this specific version is actually the one now which will

204
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,360
be supported by the Ubuntu team or Ubuntu developers so usually you want to download

205
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,600
the versions that are supported by the developers of the technology and I'm just going to click

206
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:47,360
on download and it should start automatically and as I said it has the ISO extension so

207
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:55,800
basically you could use this Linux Ubuntu installation file to install Linux on a virtual

208
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,880
machine but also on a physical laptop, right?

209
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,920
So if you wanted to install this on your computer directly without the hypervisor you would actually

210
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:13,280
use the same ISO image and the ISO file is around 3 gigabytes which means it might take

211
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:21,760
a while to download and I have the Ubuntu installer on my laptop so we can actually

212
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
use it now.

213
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:29,320
I'm going to go back to my virtual box window and if you click settings and then storage

214
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,680
you're able to select the icon next to the optical drive to upload your operating system

215
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:40,600
image to be installed so I'm going to click here and select choose disk file and we're

216
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:47,400
going to select this ISO image that we downloaded once we have added this image we can start

217
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:58,320
the virtual machine and as you see Ubuntu installation is actually starting and now

218
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,320
we have this step by step installation guide where you basically choose your language and

219
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,880
different configurations like your time zone etc to install Ubuntu.

220
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:18,040
So we have English here we're going to do install Ubuntu and again choose the language

221
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,920
I'm going to choose German because that's my keyboard layout and continue I would leave

222
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:31,720
everything on the defaults continue and here you see this warning that says that erase

223
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:39,160
disk and install Ubuntu option will basically delete all your programs documents photos

224
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,680
whatever in all operating systems.

225
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:47,720
Now don't be afraid of this warning because the disk that this refers to is actually the

226
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,800
virtual disk that we allocated to our VM right so our main operating systems disk will not

227
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,680
be affected this is really only the part that we allocated for VM which means that erasing

228
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,040
that virtual disk will not affect our main host so you don't need to worry here and

229
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,880
the reason you have this warning and it sounds so scary is because as I said this installation

230
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,560
image is actually also for the physical computers right not only for virtual machine installations

231
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:24,080
so obviously on a physical machine where you're installing it on your whole computer without

232
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,080
a hypervisor then you may consider the warning that everything will be erased on your computer

233
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,000
in our case we are starting with a blank virtual disk anyways so it doesn't matter and I'm

234
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,640
going to do install now and again we have this dialogue do you really want to change

235
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,600
or rewrite the disk to be really sure as I said this is just a virtual disk so go for

236
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:55,880
it and continue that's my location and now we're going to create the linux user and let's

237
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:09,520
call it nana.buntu password and I'm going to check login automatically and continue and

238
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,080
while it's installing and downloading different stuff it actually shows you all these things

239
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:21,720
that you can install additionally like music players and some other applications but we're

240
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,400
not going to need any of those and as I mentioned previously this linux operating system that

241
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,280
we're installing now on virtual machine doesn't actually know that it's on a virtual machine so

242
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:39,040
everything that it does is exactly the same way as you would install linux operating system on

243
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:47,960
an actual physical machine so the steps are really the same so installation completed and we're

244
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,760
actually good to go I'm going to restart while the VM is restarting remove the disk image now

245
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:02,000
that the installation is complete click devices optical drive and remove and we should see Ubuntu

246
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:17,440
desktop in our virtual machine window I'm gonna do skip and next you need to confirm some settings

247
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:25,840
here and we're good to go so basically have all these applications that are installed by default

248
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:35,320
including a Firefox browser and the linux command line now first of all you see that the input

249
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:42,360
output devices like obviously the screen but also mouse and keyboard they're all responsive here so

250
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,840
basically you are sharing these resources also between your main operating system so you can use

251
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,320
it here but also inside the virtual machine however other than that everything is completely

252
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:01,440
isolated so whatever is running inside and whatever we're doing here is completely hidden and

253
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:08,360
isolated from the host operating system so before we continue with linux let's actually see some of

254
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,480
the other options that we can set on our virtual machines from the virtual box so first of all if

255
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:23,800
I want to shut down my virtual machine I have several options one of them is saving the machine

256
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:30,560
state so that means that basically whatever state you were in for example you have a browser open

257
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,480
here with some tabs you have terminal window open maybe you have an editor where you are writing

258
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:47,640
some code you can basically save that state so all these open tabs like this so after some time if

259
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,480
you want to go back to your virtual machine and basically continue working then you can just

260
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:01,560
click start and you're gonna see your virtual machine window exactly as you left it another

261
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,840
option is just powering off the machine which basically just shuts down your virtual machine

262
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,280
it's basically just like shutting down your computer right so doing a basic shutdown here

263
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:20,920
another thing that may be very interesting especially if you're using the virtual machine to

264
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:27,600
basically learn something you may want to be able to copy and paste between your host and the virtual

265
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,120
machine and as I said the mouse and keyboard is active in both by default you can basically just

266
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:41,920
copy a text here and paste it in a virtual machine window it's not gonna work however you can

267
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:51,360
actually enable that in the settings advanced and right here shared clipboard so you can basically

268
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:59,520
set this so that you can only copy stuff from the host to the guest vice versa or you can do it by

269
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:07,680
directional and as I said this will make it convenient if you want to basically copy some

270
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,000
commands that you have on your operating system editor whatever and you want to basically just

271
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,800
paste in a terminal or maybe you have a link that you want to open in the browser here so then

272
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:29,640
may be convenient so I'm actually gonna select that and save it however for this bi-directional

273
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:36,880
clipboard sharing to work we first have to install something called an extension pack for the virtual

274
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,880
box so if we go back to this virtual box downloads page we have for the same version that we

275
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:51,480
installed here we have a VM virtual box extension pack and there is one installer for all the

276
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,240
platforms so we're gonna click on that and download so basically it's a small extra package that

277
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:08,760
lets you add some functionality to your virtual box so I'm gonna click on it and install and agree

278
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:18,920
on the licensing and there you go the extension pack was successfully installed however there is

279
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:26,760
one final thing we need to do here so that the copy pasting can work so I'm gonna open the virtual

280
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:33,880
machine first and right here on the top you have a couple of options one of them is devices and here

281
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:40,320
we have something called guest additions so guest additions package is actually the one

282
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:47,400
specifically enabling this copy paste or drag and drop functionality and if I click on insert

283
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:55,080
guest additions CD image to run the installer script open the contents of the disk drive right

284
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:05,640
click order on dot sh and select run as program authenticate so the guest additions installer

285
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:13,320
ran we can click to return and if I click on here you see this is the folder actually where all

286
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:23,760
these runners and installers are located and we can unmount it and now let's actually test the

287
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:33,280
functionality so I'm gonna copy the URL from my host and try to paste it right here and there you

288
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:42,600
go and the same way you can paste commands from your host machine to the terminal so if I'm reading

289
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,280
a tutorial and if I found some really large command that I don't want to type in I can just copy it

290
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:57,160
here on my host again back to the terminal paste and there you go so that's how you set up clipboard

291
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:03,600
sharing between the host and the virtual machine this is very convenient if you're learning or

292
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:13,720
testing out stuff in your VM another thing which is also very interesting is that by default virtual

293
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:21,280
machine actually runs in its own virtual network which is completely isolated from your host's

294
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:27,320
network right so your laptop your computer is running on your home network however the virtual

295
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:33,440
machine is not in that same network and if you actually scanned all the devices on your home

296
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,880
network you won't see your virtual machine on it and the same way if someone accessed your virtual

297
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,200
machine's network and basically hacked into it they won't be able to access your home network

298
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,640
because again they're isolated which is good for security and that's how it's set by default however

299
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:58,000
you can also change that and basically add your virtual machine to the same network as your host

300
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,840
operating system so it's gonna get an IP address within the same network and you can change that

301
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,680
settings in the network tab here however we don't need that so we're gonna leave that at the default

302
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:16,600
and there are some other things that you can basically share between the host and the guest

303
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:25,800
operating system like shared folders etc just note that when you start basically sharing stuff

304
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:32,840
between the host and guest operating systems like sharing files and folders and basically this clipboard

305
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,200
and sharing network it may be convenient because you may have use cases for that however in that

306
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,240
case we're gonna be making holes in this isolation between the host and guest operating systems right

307
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,120
which is great because the guest operating system cannot affect the host the main operating system

308
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,480
because they're completely isolated however if you start sharing resources then you are disrupting

309
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:06,600
that complete isolation so just important to be aware of that so with this type of sharing and the

310
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,680
settings you may be compromising security in our case the only thing we shared is clipboard and

311
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:21,720
everything else will stay the same and since we have linux want to set up in the next video we're

312
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:30,440
gonna go through linux operating system and learn some basics of it starting with the linux file system
