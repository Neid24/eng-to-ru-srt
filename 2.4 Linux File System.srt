1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,280
Now that we have set up Linux Virtual Machine, let's actually take a look at how Linux works

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,080
and we'll start by learning about Linux file system.

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:27,880
Something that I briefly mentioned previously, but we'll go into more detail in this video.

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,920
First of all, Linux file system is a hierarchical tree structure.

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,840
We have the root folder, just like tree root, and inside the root folder we have a couple

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,540
of folders which each has its purpose.

7
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,680
And inside those folders we have other folders and files, and the hierarchy just goes on

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,840
like that.

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,760
In comparison, the Windows file system does not have one root folder where all the folders

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,080
stem from, but rather it has multiple root folders.

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,020
So at root we have disks or drives.

12
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:09,840
This is from the early times actually when PCs only used insertable floppy disks.

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,400
So Windows used letters to assign drives for each insertable disk.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,240
So A and B for example were removable disks, so something that you would insert and then

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,760
take out again, and when hard drive was added to the PCs, the next letter which was C actually

16
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,600
became the letter for the internal disk or hard drive, and after that all the additional

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,880
disks were given the next available letter.

18
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,520
And it basically stayed mostly the same to this day.

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:51,440
So that's how file system works in Windows compared to Linux.

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,000
So now let's actually look at the Linux file system in Linux itself.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,760
First of all in operating systems with graphical user interface we always have this graphical

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,200
file system view, right?

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,440
So this file explorer program that basically shows us the folders and files and all these

24
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,760
in a graphical user interface so that we can navigate them easily.

25
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,480
And when I opened that program by default I'm inside the home directory of my user,

26
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,080
the user that I am actually logged in with, which is called Nana, right?

27
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,800
This is the user that we created.

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,960
So every user on Linux will get its own folder, basically own space inside the home directory.

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,160
And this is where I'm at and there are some default directories that are created for each

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,400
user and you see the list of them right here.

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,080
We have the desktop folder, documents, downloads, etc.

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,040
Now this is actually one of the folders in the root of the file system.

33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,840
So how do we actually get to the root folder instead of being in our home directory?

34
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:10,280
If I click on other locations here and computer and click on it you see that now I'm actually

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,400
inside the root directory, right?

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,720
Inside the computer root and inside the root folder you see home directory.

37
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,320
And this is basically where all Linux user spaces are located.

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,760
So each user will have its own space in the home directory except for the root user, which

39
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,000
actually has its own isolated folder separate from all other users.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,400
And that is the root directory right here.

41
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,280
So this is the home directory for a root user and this is the home directory for all

42
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,680
other users.

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,240
So let's click inside that home directory and you see that I have a directory folder

44
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,800
for my user with the username.

45
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,280
And if I click inside you see that I go back to my default location, right?

46
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,720
This is basically my user's home space.

47
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,360
So this is one of the most important folder locations basically you have to know in Linux.

48
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,400
And it works pretty similar on other operating systems where every user basically has their

49
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,960
own space.

50
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,920
And it's important to isolate them because most of the operating systems, most of the

51
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,400
computers actually support multi-user on their systems, right?

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,440
So you have multiple users on your computer, obviously you don't want to mess with each

53
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,080
other's programs or settings or whatever.

54
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:43,480
So each user can have their own personal configuration for browser configuration for maybe an editor,

55
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,160
maybe programs that only the user wants to use and so on.

56
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,600
And all of that happens in that user's home directory.

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:58,160
However, in addition to the programs and files that only your user needs to see, there are

58
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,520
also programs that has to be available system-wide.

59
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,760
System-wide basically means installed on a computer which is automatically available

60
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,800
to all the users, right?

61
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,600
So they're not in a home directory of your user, they are basically available on the

62
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,560
outer level, so outside the home directory and available for all the users of your computer.

63
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,120
And this could be applications or also commands, Linux commands that are available on the whole

64
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,040
system and for all the users.

65
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,840
So where are those actually located?

66
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,960
Again going back to the root on a computer, you see that we have a bunch of other folders

67
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,480
here in addition to home.

68
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,640
And let's actually start with folder bin which stands for binary.

69
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:58,000
So if I click inside, so bin folder inside the root directory contains the most basic

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,160
commands you have available on your operating system.

71
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,280
Some of these commands are for example, cat which basically shows you the contents of

72
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,480
a file, you also have cp which basically copies a file, echo and so on.

73
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:20,640
So basically all these basic commands that you use in Linux, they are all located or

74
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,760
the binary files for those commands are all located in this bin directory.

75
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,680
And that means that they are available system wide for all the users but also to the system

76
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,040
itself.

77
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,040
Now what is binary exactly?

78
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:44,000
Binary is simply a format that computer understands, so instead of text, binary values are represented

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,880
in zeros and ones and that's what a computer can interpret.

80
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,600
So to execute a command, it must be in a binary format, so a computer can actually understand

81
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,920
that command.

82
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:04,280
And that's why all these commands that we use on a command line are in binary files.

83
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,080
And that's why they're in a folder called bin which stands for binary.

84
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,480
And we're going to actually go through those basic commands in more detail in the next

85
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,600
section.

86
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:23,160
Now going back to the root, we have another folder which is called sbin.

87
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,200
So these are binaries but for different commands, these are system binaries.

88
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:36,240
Again if I click inside, you will see a bunch of other commands and the difference between

89
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:44,400
the two is actually that these commands are system relevant, that these commands actually

90
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,600
need a super user permission to execute them.

91
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:55,480
Now the commands are, as you see, add user, so adding users, also setting passwords for

92
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:03,280
those users, or changing passwords, doing network configuration with IP tables, etc.

93
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,840
So all these commands that you see here need super user privilege so you can't actually

94
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,600
execute them with a normal user.

95
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,720
So the system bin commands would be used by administrators to administer the system

96
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,160
but also by the system itself to run some commands.

97
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:32,720
And again we will see how to execute commands with a super user privilege in the next section.

98
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:40,760
And we also have these leap or library folders which basically hold the libraries for those

99
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,040
binaries or for those commands, right?

100
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:50,240
Because they are just executables but if they need a library to do something else, those

101
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,760
libraries are actually located here.

102
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,440
So one program can actually be split into different locations, having the executable

103
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,520
files here and having the libraries here, or the same way having the executable binary

104
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,560
files here and having the libraries here.

105
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,840
And that's kind of a common way of splitting the location of a program when you install

106
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,720
them on Linux.

107
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,040
Now let's actually go to a folder called usr which stands for user originally.

108
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,920
So this folder was actually the user location before home directory was added.

109
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,120
And if you look inside the user folder, we actually see a bunch of folders, however,

110
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:47,800
we have binary folder here as well, S binary or system binary folder as well, and library

111
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,480
or library folders.

112
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,240
So the same concept as we saw on the root level but inside the user folder.

113
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,200
So what is this about?

114
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,560
If I click inside, you will actually see the same commands that we saw in the binary

115
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,680
and the root folder here as well.

116
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:15,600
So we have the package manager command, apt, for example, cat command, copy command, echo

117
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
and so on.

118
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,040
So basically the same commands that we saw in the root folders binary folder.

119
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,120
So what's going on here?

120
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,360
Basically this is also a binary folder for all those commands and the same way if we

121
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,440
look inside the S bin, we would see those administrator commands here, right?

122
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,400
And they have their libraries basically located here.

123
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:47,480
And that actually has a historical reason of how this was designed originally in Unix.

124
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:54,160
So basically because of the limitations of a storage, the split was made to store some

125
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,000
of the binaries in the root folder binary or system binary folders and the rest of them

126
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,440
in the user folder.

127
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,520
And the limitation was of course, because back in the time the storages were much more

128
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,360
limited in size.

129
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,120
However since that limitation actually doesn't exist anymore, now we have those binary files

130
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,640
actually duplicated in those two places.

131
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,320
So the split doesn't make sense anymore, however the concept still remains from the old times

132
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,280
and that's why we have these duplicated binaries basically till now.

133
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:37,800
And be aware that when we execute those commands, ls and copy and some basic commands, whenever

134
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:46,120
we execute them on a terminal, they are usually executed from the user bin folder.

135
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,920
Another difference between those two locations are that on some operating systems, the outer

136
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,520
level bin and S bin folders actually contain less number of commands.

137
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:06,320
So they basically have just a handful of commands inside and then the user folder bin and S

138
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,120
bin would have much more commands.

139
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:17,540
So just be aware that those two are very similar, so you have the system wide essential commands

140
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,960
basically located in those two places.

141
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:28,880
Now inside the user folder there is another folder called local and this local folder

142
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,560
also has bin, S bin and lib folders plus some other stuff and here the differentiation is

143
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,760
actually pretty clear because this is a location where the applications that you as a Linux

144
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,840
user are installing yourself will actually go.

145
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:53,320
So that's where third party applications that you install on the system will be located.

146
00:12:53,320 --> 00:13:00,440
For example, this could be Docker, Docker compose, Minicube, Java, Python, whatever.

147
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:07,280
So these extra applications that you installed on your system will go here and that's why

148
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,120
it's called local.

149
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,720
And again, as I said, the application installation will be split into these different folders.

150
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,840
So if you're installing Java, for example, the binary files of Java commands will go

151
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,540
here, the libraries will go here, the documentation will go somewhere else, configuration in another

152
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,040
folder and so on.

153
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:37,120
And we're going to actually install some applications like Java and Docker, etc. on Linux and we're

154
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,800
going to see that the installer or the package manager tool that we're going to use to install

155
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,640
that will automatically put the program files in these locations.

156
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:55,400
And note again that the user folder is actually inside the root.

157
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,080
So everything that you install here in this local folder will be available for all the

158
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,760
users on your computer.

159
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,620
So these are going to be system wide application installations.

160
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:12,000
So if you install Docker here, every user on your computer will actually have Docker available

161
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,720
in their home space, right?

162
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,280
So they will be able to use Docker, the same goes for Java.

163
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:23,180
However, on Linux, you can actually install applications only for your user, which makes

164
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,820
sense because maybe only you're interested in having Docker and other users on the same

165
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,620
computer do not actually need Docker.

166
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:42,300
So in that case, you would install it in your user's home directory.

167
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:50,260
Now there is another location in Linux where the third party or external applications will

168
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,500
be installed.

169
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,980
And that is this optional folder.

170
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,580
And if I click inside, first of all, you see it's empty because we haven't installed any

171
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,540
applications yet.

172
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,740
We're just starting from an empty Linux installation.

173
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:10,540
So this folder is empty as well as user local bin folder, right?

174
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,440
We haven't installed any external applications yet.

175
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,900
So both of these locations are empty.

176
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,900
So what is the difference between this opt directory and user local directory?

177
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:29,900
The difference is that there are actually some applications that do not split their code

178
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:37,900
or their files in different directories, like having the binaries in the bin folder, libraries

179
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
in the lib folder, etc.

180
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,460
These programs would install everything in one directory.

181
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,380
And because of that, there is this opt or optional folder where such applications will

182
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,380
be installed.

183
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:56,180
An example of such an application would be most of the IDEs, which are basically code

184
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,220
editors for different programming languages.

185
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:05,660
So that would be actually installed in slash opt, where everything will be in one folder,

186
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,540
the binaries, libraries, documentation, shared files, etc.

187
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,920
This could also be, for example, web browsers that you install, and so on.

188
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,280
So that is a dedicated location for those type of applications.

189
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,200
Again, whatever you install here will be system-wide available for all the users.

190
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:30,320
So these are basically the most essential or most important directories in Linux file

191
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,880
system, but we also have some other ones that are also interesting.

192
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,600
So let's go through them very quickly.

193
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,360
First of all, we have this boot directory, which is basically for booting the system.

194
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,600
And that means that we should never touch that.

195
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,000
This is actually a folder where we, as users, never do anything.

196
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,320
This is exclusively for the system itself.

197
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,200
And at this point, I want to mention that all the folders that I showed you till now

198
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,920
are actually read-only folders.

199
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,560
So when an application is installed, for example, it will go in this opt or use a local directory,

200
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,520
once, so everything will be installed once.

201
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,080
And after that, that will be read-only, right?

202
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:21,520
You don't change the binary files, you don't change the libraries, etc.

203
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:31,480
However, there is a location in the root directory where the system configuration is stored.

204
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,600
This would be network interface configuration, etc.

205
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,580
This could be the Linux user data and the passwords.

206
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,580
So basically things that are writable, not only read-only, but we can change them.

207
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:49,580
And this configuration is located in this etc or etc. folder.

208
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:57,660
Originally, it was for etc., meaning everything else, which was not here, but it actually

209
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:05,620
emerged into being the main configuration location for different applications, as I said,

210
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:11,100
for users, groups, network configuration, etc.

211
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,540
So for example, here you see MySQL, so we have the MySQL configuration here.

212
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:23,860
We have Python configuration and a bunch of other .conf or configuration files for other

213
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,100
applications.

214
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:33,940
So all of them are located in one place, which is etc.

215
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:40,460
Another folder, which is interesting, is dev folder, which actually stands for devices.

216
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,860
And this is where the devices that are connected to your computer will actually be stored.

217
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:53,900
So mouse, keyboard, monitor, external devices that you connect to your computer, like USBs,

218
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,900
etc.

219
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,660
Or the hard drive, that would all be in this dev location.

220
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:09,300
So all the files that system needs to interact with this hardware basically will be here.

221
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:14,340
When the operating system starts, it actually logs some data.

222
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:20,860
And these logs are actually stored in a folder called bar inside the log folder.

223
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,500
And that means if something went wrong or you want to see your system logs, basically,

224
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,020
they're all located here.

225
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,540
We also have cache.

226
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,380
So basically all the cache data from your applications will be stored here.

227
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,100
And generally this var folder is for storing logs from different processes that are running

228
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,620
on your computer.

229
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,660
We also have a temp directory that basically stores some temporary files for different applications.

230
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:56,380
So for example, if an application in the background is doing some process and it needs to temporarily

231
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,340
save the data, it will be written here.

232
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:06,060
And at some point they will be then deleted.

233
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,900
We also have media and mount folders.

234
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:16,660
So media is basically where your external media is mounted into.

235
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:23,020
External hard drive, maybe a network drive or USB, when you plug that into your computer,

236
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:29,060
they will be automatically in the background actually mounted into this media folder.

237
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,500
And they will also be referenced in the devices folder.

238
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:41,180
And for manually mounting, for example, file systems to your operating system, you have

239
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,220
this mount folder.

240
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,300
So as I said, this happens automatically.

241
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,820
But if you want to manually mount, for example, a file system to your operating system, then

242
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,420
you can use the mount folder for that.

243
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:03,500
Now one thing to note here is that usually you will not be interacting with these folders.

244
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,780
When you install applications using a package manager tool or installer or whatever, and

245
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:15,220
when you interact with your operating system, you will not be directly updating this stuff

246
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,220
here.

247
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,820
Whether the application installer or package manager tool or the operating system itself

248
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,860
will be actually updating the folders here, right?

249
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:30,860
So as I said, if you plug in a USB, basically, it will automatically be mounted in your system.

250
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:36,460
And then you will see basically the folders or files on that USB without you having to

251
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,900
mount anything manually here.

252
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,140
And the same way when you change configuration in your system, they will automatically be

253
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,380
updated in this configuration, location in the ETC, et cetera.

254
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:53,340
And when you install an application, the package manager tool, for example, which you used,

255
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,820
will handle putting the right files into right locations.

256
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,440
It will track where everything is going.

257
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,940
So when you remove the package or application, it basically cleans up everything and it removes

258
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,420
those files from all the different locations.

259
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,580
So you don't have to actually do anything manually here.

260
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,820
But if you're debugging or troubleshooting, it's actually good to know where things are

261
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:22,700
located so you know where to look for them.

262
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:29,700
And finally, an important concept related to file system is something called hidden files.

263
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,340
To show you what that is, let's head back to our user's home directory.

264
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,140
And you see here we have a couple of folders.

265
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:44,420
Well, actually there are some other files and folders right here in this home directory

266
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,580
of my user that you don't see by default.

267
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:54,460
And to see them, we can actually go here in the settings options and check show hidden

268
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:01,180
files and you see those hidden files and folders displayed here.

269
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,220
So what are these?

270
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:09,980
The hidden files and folders are usually automatically generated by different applications.

271
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,580
And they all start with a dot.

272
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:18,660
And that's why in Unix operating systems, the hidden files are also called dot files.

273
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:24,140
And different applications will automatically create them to store configurations, some

274
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,020
scripts they need to execute, etc.

275
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:34,500
For example, right here you see a dot Mozilla folder for the Mozilla Firefox browser, right?

276
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,660
So here Firefox browser will actually store some configuration options as well as maybe

277
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:46,780
application logs and generally data that that application would need.

278
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:52,660
In addition to applications themselves generating these folders and files, you also have operating

279
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:59,700
system itself generating some of these folders and files specifically for your user.

280
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,620
Again we are in one specific user's home directory.

281
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:10,460
And these are actually some of the files that hold the configuration for your user.

282
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:16,300
So if you have some user preferences that you've configured in your operating system

283
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,060
only for your user, they will be stored here.

284
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:26,780
So you have this profile for a user, you have cache where applications that you use in your

285
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,660
user space will store some cache data.

286
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,580
You have configuration from different applications and operating system again specific to your

287
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,580
user.

288
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,700
And this way every user can basically configure the operating system to their needs and have

289
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,620
their own preferences without interfering with each other.

290
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,700
And that will be all stored right here.

291
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:54,500
So the difference is basically that these are automatically created files and folders

292
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:01,220
either by the operating system or applications where you don't usually modify some stuff.

293
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:07,020
And the main purpose of hiding these files by default is basically to have a cleaner

294
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,220
overview when you're displaying your folders.

295
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,740
So you don't see a bunch of automatically generated files and folders in each directory.

296
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,340
So basically it's just for a cleaner visual display of directories.

297
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:28,500
And you have hidden folders in all operating systems and they use them in the same way.

298
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,740
So Windows has them, Mac OS has them and obviously Linux distributions have them.

299
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,620
And we're going to actually see the usage, the actual usage of some of those hidden files

300
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,140
and folders in the next sections.

301
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:50,420
And you as a user could also actually create hidden folders and files if you need it to.

302
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:56,820
So when creating a folder or file, you just have to prepend dot and then basically name

303
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,820
of the file or folder, let's just call it test.

304
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:07,740
And you just get a note here that it's going to be a hidden folder, create and now if we

305
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,660
hide them again, you don't see it here.

306
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:16,300
And we're going to see some specific cases where you would create a hidden file.

307
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:22,620
But as I said, mostly they're automatically generated by program or operating system itself.
