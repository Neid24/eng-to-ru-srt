00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now that you've learned Linux file system, it's time to learn basic Linux commands that you can execute in a command line interface to work with that file system to create folders, files to display the information in your system, etc.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So first of all, obviously we start with a graphical user interface, which is everything that you see right here.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's visual, it's graphical, and as a user, it's a simple starting point to interact with your operating system.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You can open applications here, you can install new applications, you can create new folders, new files, etc.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And everything that you can do in a graphical user interface, you can also do in a command line interface.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And the application for displaying and working with command line interface is called a terminal, which just like all these other applications here is also an application, which we can open in our system.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I'm actually going to move this unnecessary stuff here so that we have that right on display.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So graphical user interface and command line interface are basically two different interfaces that we as operating system users interact with the operating system.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And on personal computers and laptops, usually have both on servers, you would get a command line interface and no graphical user interface.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And that's why as a DevOps engineer, since you're going to be working with servers, you need to have the skill and you need to know how to work with command line interface.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:06,000
However, as we're going to see this as we go along, working with command line interface also on your personal computer or laptop can actually be more convenient than just using the graphical user interface.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So let's get started with it.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
First of all, what you see here is something called a terminal window, right? So we have a terminal application here.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And just like you have browser tips or browser windows, you have terminal windows and you can open as many of them as you want.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And right here you see a line with a bunch of information.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The first one here is the name of the Linux user that is currently logged in and using this terminal.

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm logged in as a user Nana and that's why I actually see that information in the terminal.

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The second part here, this string is the computer name.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So whatever your computer is called, if it has an automatically generated name or something that you named yourself, you will see that information right here.

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And with personal computers, obviously, mostly you would know this.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:19,000
However, when you log into a server, that's actually pretty convenient to know exactly which machine you're on and which user you're logged in as.

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So for a server, this actually will be a host name of that computer.

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So in server environments, when you're doing stuff on multiple different servers and you may have maybe 10 different servers open,

24
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
it's important to keep track on which computer you're executing different stuff.

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And after that we have this character here called tilled, right?

26
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Tilt is actually a shortcut to a home directory of the user.

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm in my Nana user's home directory, and that's the path, so to say, to my home, which is this character.

28
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And then we have dollar sign, which means that you are working as a regular user on an operating system.

29
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're not a super user, you're a regular user.

30
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you're logged in as a root user and executing commands as root, then this will be a pound sign instead of the dollar sign.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And again, all this is very practical when working on several machines at once so that you don't forget and get confused of what status is on each of those servers.

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Great, so this is actually an interface where you write commands for a computer to execute.

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So instead of creating a folder here, you would write a command for a computer to create a folder.
