1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,720
So let's say the parallels and comparison between doing something in graphical user interface

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,040
and in a command line interface.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,200
So first of all, in a file explorer program of your operating system, you have this visual

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:30,680
view of which folder you're in at the moment and which folders or files are inside that

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,000
current directory.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,920
And you can do that in a command line interface as well.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,120
First of all, you can display which folder you are currently in.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,680
And this is a default folder that you are in when you open the terminal.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,840
And I can display that using command called PWD, which basically means print working

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
directory.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:59,320
And I'm going to execute, and you see that location that I am in right now in my terminal.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,600
And that is the same as this location here, slash home slash Nana.

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,680
And we learned that in the previous file system lecture, that every user has a folder in a

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,840
home directory, and as a user Nana, by default, I am inside that directory in the graphic

15
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,120
user interface as well as in terminal.

16
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:30,080
Now how can I display the folders or files which are in my current working directory?

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,720
I can do that using LS, which basically means list and enter.

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,680
And I see the same list of folders right here.

19
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,280
Currently I don't have any files here, I just have folders.

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,600
Now what about going into a different directory in graphical user interface?

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,000
I can just click inside a folder, and I'm inside documents directory now, right?

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,080
In command line interface, it's also super easy.

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,560
I just do CD, which means change directory, and then directory name, which is documents.

24
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,560
And if I execute, now you see in the path here, before the cursor, now it shows tilled

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,720
slash documents.

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,240
And tilled is, as we learned already, is the same as, or it's a shortcut actually of this

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,280
path here.

28
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,040
So now if I do WPD, that's the location inside my operating system, which I'm currently

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,080
in.

30
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:40,400
So using the CD command, I can actually navigate my file system by going up and down the file

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,200
system hierarchy.

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,000
In GUI, I can also create folders, right?

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,120
So using this button here, let's say I want to create a folder for my application.

34
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
And there you go.

35
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,280
The same way I can create folders very easily in a command line interface.

36
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:11,200
So that I have a command called mkdir, which stands for make directory, and the directory

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
name.

38
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,960
Let's say we are creating a folder for a Python project.

39
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,360
So I'm going to call this Python project.

40
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,440
And now you see that we have another folder here.

41
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:37,160
In the same way, I can display the current list of folders inside the documents folder.

42
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,320
Now what about creating files in the directories?

43
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm going to go inside the web application.

44
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:52,840
And to create a file in user interface, you would have some kind of editor, a simple text

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,360
editor doesn't matter, could be also a document writer.

46
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,320
And we're going to write some text here and save it.

47
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:14,000
And let's say this is a readme file for our application and save it.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,840
So in GUI, I have to open an editor, I have to save that file into a folder, etc.

49
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,760
In command line, I can actually do that with one command.

50
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:29,600
So first, I'm going to go inside the Python project.

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,320
And inside that, I'm going to create a file.

52
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,360
And command for that is touch, and then filing.

53
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,560
And let's say this is a main dot Python file.

54
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,800
This could be a text file, this could be HTML file, whatever you want, you just have this

55
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,680
dot extension, and it will create any type of file.

56
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,840
So you don't need any editor for that.

57
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,940
I'm going to enter, and if I do ls, in Python project, I have this main dot py file.

58
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,440
And the same way I can remove files and folders.

59
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,960
So if I want to remove this, this file, I can just do rm, which stands for remove, main

60
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,000
dot py, and there you go, the folder is empty.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,840
Now let's actually delete the Python project folder.

62
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,080
Now how do I navigate up the file system hierarchy?

63
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:36,480
For that, with CD, I can do dot dot, and that will basically take me one step, or one level

64
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,520
up the file system tree.

65
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,480
So now I'm in the documents again, and if I want to remove the Python project, I can

66
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,520
use the same remove command.

67
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,440
Now if I do remove Python project, and execute, you see that it gives me a warning, cannot

68
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,920
remove Python project, it's a directory.

69
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,360
So basically when you're removing folders, not files with the remove command, you have

70
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:10,520
to add a flag here with minus r, that stands for recursive.

71
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,760
So basically, for folders, we want to recursively remove everything.

72
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:20,680
So if I had other folders inside the Python project, and files, all of them will be recursively

73
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,200
removed.

74
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,320
And enter, there you go, Python project is gone.

75
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:37,000
So this dash here, with some character, is actually a very common way to pass additional

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,240
parameters to your command, right?

77
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,000
To tell your command, hey, remove this folder, but do this recursively.

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,280
And we're going to see some other examples of that later.

79
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:56,000
In the previous video, we also checked out the directories in a root folder, right?

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,680
So folders that are on the same level as the home directory.

81
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,360
So if we needed to check some logs here, system logs, or do something here, how do we actually

82
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,360
navigate to the root folder from a command line interface?

83
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,600
Well, the root folder in command line interface is actually represented with the character

84
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,080
of forward slash.

85
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,080
And if I execute this, this will actually bring me to the root folder.

86
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,680
And since we're at the bottom of the terminal window and we need some more space, I'm actually

87
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,260
going to execute another command called clear.

88
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,880
And this will clean up the terminal history and give us more space.

89
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,040
So as you see here, we have, instead of tilt, we now have a forward slash.

90
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,120
And if I do pwd, we are in a root folder.

91
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,800
And if I do ls here, it will show me all the folders inside the root directory.

92
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,120
Now there is one interesting point about Linux, and that's that everything in Linux is actually

93
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,880
a file.

94
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,720
So obviously, the text document or picture is a file, but also a directory is represented

95
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,400
as a file.

96
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,040
Linux commands that we are executing here, like pwd or ls or cd, these are all represented

97
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:30,120
as binary files, which are located in one of those bin folders, either here or in user

98
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,360
directory.

99
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:39,360
The devices that you connect to your computer, like mouse, keyboard, USB, whatever, which

100
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,920
are then shown in the dev folder, they're also represented as files.

101
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,040
And since everything is a file in Linux, you can actually work with them just like files.

102
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,080
You can copy them, you can move them from one place to another, you can show the contents

103
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,240
of those files, etc.

104
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:06,040
As I said, you shouldn't be changing anything here in the root directory, but just as an

105
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,040
interesting info to be aware of.

106
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:19,240
Now from command line, you can actually easily navigate the hierarchy of the file system

107
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,880
through multiple layers.

108
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:29,040
So for example, if I wanted to go to a bin folder in a user's local directory, I would

109
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,720
have to basically follow this path.

110
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,640
In command line, it's just one command, which basically lets you specify the whole path

111
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
like this.

112
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,640
So you have user folder, you have local inside, and you have bin.

113
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,640
If I do that, I'm inside that folder.

114
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,200
Now if I wanted to go back to the user folder, I could either do this.

115
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:09,920
So basically move to here case up the file system, or do root folder user.

116
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
And there you go.

117
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:18,400
So basically from anywhere in your file system, you can specify an absolute path of any location.

118
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,440
So for example, if I want to check my network configuration by providing what's called an

119
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,760
absolute path.

120
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:32,720
So absolute path is a term that's basically used for describing the full, the complete

121
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,560
path of any location.

122
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:42,400
So basically, if I wanted to switch to the network folder inside etc, I can provide the

123
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:49,880
absolute path that starts with root, and I will switch there.

124
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:56,480
The same way I can go out back to my home directory like this, or as we also learned

125
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,480
as a shortcut from anywhere in the file system, I can just do tilt.

126
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,040
So with a tilt character, we can actually go back to our home directory.

127
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,640
Now one convenience of using an LS or list command is that we don't actually have to

128
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,840
switch to another location to display the contents of a folder, right, of a directory.

129
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,360
So for example, if I wanted to see the network configuration without actually switching to

130
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,840
that folder, and I wanted to stay in the home directory, I can just do ls slash etc.

131
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:44,880
And remember absolute path starting from the root folder slash etc slash network.

132
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
And there you go.

133
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,280
I'm still inside the home directory, but I can display files or contents from any other

134
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
directory.

135
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
Again, let's clean this up.

136
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,720
And now let's actually move back to our documents folder with Sydney.

137
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,760
And another great thing about command line is that when I type the first couple of letters,

138
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:13,400
I can actually hit the tab key on my keyboard, and it will actually show me all the folders

139
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,040
that start with those letters.

140
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:22,360
So right now I have documents and downloads, and if I do doc and hit the tab again, it's

141
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,480
going to autocomplete that, right.

142
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,440
So I don't have to remember or type out the folder names all the time.

143
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,820
That's obviously helpful when navigating up and down the directories.

144
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:41,480
So let's switch to the documents folder.

145
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:48,160
And let's say we want to rename the web application folder to Java app, because that's what we

146
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
decided on as a name.

147
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,840
So to change the name for that, there is a command called mv, which actually stands

148
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,640
for move.

149
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,560
And we need an original name after that, and the new name.

150
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,320
So we are basically moving or changing web application to Java app.

151
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,520
And I'm going to execute and we have renamed the folder.

152
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:21,200
And again, I can check the contents of that folder without entering it and with autocomplete.

153
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,880
And let's say I have added some Java files here, create some application, and I actually

154
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,720
want to keep a copy of this folder to create another project, another Java project based

155
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,040
on that, right.

156
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,760
So basically I want to copy the folder with all the contents.

157
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:47,720
For that I can do CP, which stands for copy Java app.

158
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:55,160
And let's call this something else like my project.

159
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,600
And again, we see the warning on folders.

160
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,560
When we're copying a folder and it includes files or folders inside, we need to tell the

161
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:14,120
copy command to do it recursively, again, adding this minus r flag.

162
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:21,640
And if we do ls, and if we display my project, it should also have the read me file copied

163
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,240
from Java.

164
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,160
The same way we can actually copy and rename files.

165
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,680
So first let's say I want to create another copy of adjusted read me.

166
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,360
So let's say I want to have another read me for test environment, right, which has mostly

167
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,080
the same thing, but I want to adjust it a little bit.

168
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:54,160
So I can copy that with files, I don't need recursive because just one file.

169
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,600
And now I have two files, and let's say I find just read me confusing.

170
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:08,000
So I want to rename that to read me deaf.

171
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,820
And there you go.

172
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:15,940
So same commands for copying or renaming it.

173
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,140
Cool.

174
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,900
Let's go back to our home directory and clear our window.

175
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,940
And let's see some other cool and practical commands.

176
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:35,780
So we already saw that with ls and the folder name, I can display directories in a certain

177
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,780
location.

178
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,340
Now let's say that I wanted to display these two folders, but I also wanted to display

179
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,420
the contents inside those two folders.

180
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:53,500
First of all, for that, I can add a flag here with minus with dash and that flag is capital

181
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:59,060
R this time, which again stands for recursive and documents.

182
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:05,980
And if I execute, you see that I see those directories inside, but per directory, I also

183
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,740
see the contents inside Java app and my project as well.

184
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,220
And again, that could be practical if you don't want to switch up and down and navigate

185
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,380
up and down the directories, you just want to see everything in one display.

186
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,700
Another cool thing with command line is that you don't have to retype everything all the

187
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:32,020
time with the arrow keys on your keyboard for up and down, you can actually navigate

188
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:36,560
the commands from your history of command execution.

189
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,260
So for example, if you want to execute a command from the previous execution again, you can

190
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,300
just search it here in the history and execute it.

191
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:54,140
And that brings us to another topic related to command line, which is a history of command

192
00:16:54,140 --> 00:17:00,020
line by default, whatever commands you're executing in this window will be saved into

193
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,960
a history file, right?

194
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,920
So you have your command execution history.

195
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:11,320
And if we type a command called history here, it will actually display us line by line,

196
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,440
all the commands that we executed in this session.

197
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,600
And this could be very practical if, for example, you want to remember what you did on the command

198
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,020
line, or maybe you want to remember the command that you executed and maybe copy that and

199
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,680
execute it again.

200
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:37,480
Another practical way of finding a command that you previously executed is by searching

201
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,320
it on the command line.

202
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,120
And you can do that by using a key combination on your keyboard, which will be control and

203
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:53,480
R. And this will give you a search input, so to say, reverse search where you can type

204
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:01,400
a command that you're looking for, for example, s or cd, and I will see the commands that

205
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:09,920
I executed that start with these characters, let's also do rm.

206
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,400
So that will be another convenient way of finding the old commands that you executed.

207
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:22,120
Another useful key combination is whenever you want to break out of a command execution

208
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,960
result, or you want to stop execution of something, a program here, then you can click control

209
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,880
C, and that will basically interrupt or kill the current process that is running in the

210
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,640
terminal, like the search process right here.

211
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,660
Another useful key combination is copying and pasting in the terminal.

212
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:55,840
So let's say you want to find a command that shows you the last 20 commands in your history

213
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,340
of command execution.

214
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:04,060
By default, if I do history, you get all your commands, let's say you only want to display

215
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,460
last 20 or let's say last 10.

216
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:14,620
And let's say you search that in a browser, history, last 10 commands, and you find the

217
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,660
answer on stack exchange, whatever, and you copy that, obviously, this is much more practical

218
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,980
if it's a long command.

219
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:30,860
In this case, you would just copy that and now you want to paste it in your terminal.

220
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:38,900
For that, you're going to use control shift and V, and this will paste whatever you copied

221
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,420
inside the terminal.

222
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,700
And obviously, this will be very practical if you have much larger commands, much longer

223
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:56,340
commands that you don't want to retype here, and this will give us last 20 commands.

224
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,540
And one final command is displaying hidden files.

225
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,660
In the file system lecture, you already learned that in your home directory, you usually have

226
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,380
hidden files that you can display like this.

227
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:15,340
And these are basically all sorts of hidden files or hidden folders that different programs

228
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:21,940
and applications generate to store their configuration there or to store binaries or whatever.

229
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:28,860
And sometimes you may need to look inside them or navigate them or check some stuff.

230
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:36,180
For example, one of the hidden files here, which is called bash history, actually contains

231
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:41,380
the history of your commands that we output it right here.

232
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,820
So there will be enough use cases for navigating through and displaying the hidden files and

233
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,820
directories.

234
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,700
So how do we access them or how do we see them in a terminal?

235
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,680
And that's actually pretty easy.

236
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,060
So I'm in the home directory where I have a bunch of hidden files, and if I want to

237
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:08,140
display them, I'm going to pass in an argument with dash A. And if I execute, this will actually

238
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,220
show me all the files and folders, including the hidden ones.

239
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:19,940
And the same way as I navigate in these other directories, I can navigate in the hidden

240
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:26,020
folders like this and display the contents of the folder.

241
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,500
So we know how to display the contents of a folder.

242
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:37,100
But how do we display contents of a file, whether it's a hidden file or a regular file?

243
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,660
In graphical user interface, you just click on the file and it basically shows you the

244
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,780
contents like this.

245
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,220
In terminal, it's actually also very easy.

246
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,700
You just do CAT, which actually stands for concatenate.

247
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:57,940
It's a fancy word for combining words together.

248
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,460
And that's the command we use to display file contents.

249
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:07,260
So in this case, let's display bash.

250
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,100
And let's do tab for completion.

251
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:17,460
And we can display contents of regular files the same way.

252
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,260
Let's do Java app and read me.

253
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,860
And there you go.

254
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:34,100
Now all these commands that we just saw in this lecture, these super basic commands for

255
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:39,460
working with files and folders and navigating the file system.

256
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,060
These commands are actually the ones you are going to be using most of the time.

257
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,900
So people usually think that to be good at Linux, you have to memorize tons of different

258
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,900
commands.

259
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,980
And in reality, you have these around 20 commands maybe that you have to know and which you

260
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,540
will be using most of the time.

261
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,660
And the rest of the commands, either you're never going to use them or if you need them,

262
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,380
once in a while, you can just basically Google that or look that up.

263
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,820
So you don't have to memorize hundreds of commands, because you're just going to be

264
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,220
working with a handful of them.

265
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:26,860
So with these basic commands, you can actually already do a lot in Linux.

266
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,940
Also some people may think at the beginning, why would use command line interface when

267
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:38,180
you have a graphical user interface, which is more visual and much easier to navigate

268
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,180
and use.

269
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:44,280
Well, first of all, if you get used to the command line interface, you can actually work

270
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:50,740
much more efficiently and much quickly, because you don't have to click through all these

271
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:56,700
folders and applications and stuff, you have everything in just one window, right in one

272
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,500
terminal and you just basically execute commands inside that, right.

273
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,660
So you save a lot of time and some commands actually make it easier, certain stuff than

274
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,180
if you did them on a graphical user interface.

275
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,620
Another advantage of command line is that if you are doing some bulk operations on your

276
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:22,580
files or folders, so basically you're changing a lot of stuff at the same time, you can do

277
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:29,140
that much easier on a command line interface through a command than doing that through

278
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:35,820
a GUI, like bulk creating folders, files, renaming them or moving stuff around command

279
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,620
line interface may actually be much easier for that.

280
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:45,820
And finally, command line interface can actually do more than graphical user interface.

281
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:51,820
So command line is actually much more powerful than graphical user interface, and also for

282
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:58,660
certain repetitive tasks, or bulk commands, you can actually do that faster in the terminal

283
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:04,820
than in the GUI, this could be updating or moving 100 files or renaming them, etc.

284
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,980
But of course there are tasks where you can't replace the graphical user interface with

285
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,980
the command line, and these are visual tasks like editing images or videos or browsing

286
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:22,740
internet, obviously you would do that with graphical user interface.

287
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:29,060
Now in addition to working with files and folders, you can also use command line interface

288
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,620
to display some really useful information about your operating system.

289
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:38,100
So for example, with one command, you can display all the information about the kernel,

290
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,740
its version, which distribution, etc. you're using.

291
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:52,180
With uname-a, this will give us the complete information, which kernel, kernel version,

292
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,820
computer name, etc.

293
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,100
So you get all this information here.

294
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:07,100
You can also display operating system release, like this, by reading the file contents of

295
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:18,220
slashetc slash osrelease file, and this will basically tell you this is an Ubuntu distribution

296
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,420
with this version.

297
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,660
You can also check information about your hardware.

298
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:30,500
So for example, if I want to check CPU information for my system, I can do ls, which is command

299
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,700
we already learned, and CPU.

300
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,180
And this will give you detailed info about the architecture that you're using, how many

301
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:47,420
CPUs you have, how many cores, which model it is, etc.

302
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:52,900
And in the same way, you can display memory information like this, so you have the total

303
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,820
memory that your system is using, etc.

304
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,380
And know that, obviously, this is the memory that we allocated when we created the virtual

305
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,660
machine, and you see that information here.

306
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:10,220
So basically, in addition to these very common and basic commands, you have a bunch of these

307
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,060
other commands, which are also useful if you want to get some more information about your

308
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,340
system, etc.

309
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,540
But again, as I said, you're not going to be using this type of commands very often,

310
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,540
maybe.

311
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,780
So whenever you need them, you can actually look them up so you don't have to memorize

312
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:31,580
all the commands.

313
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:39,060
And finally, the last important concept with commands that we need to cover is executing

314
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,860
commands as a super user.

315
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:49,340
If you remember, in the file system lecture, we learned that in slash S bin folder, we

316
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:55,220
have all these commands that are meant for super user execution, right?

317
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:00,260
Administrators would basically use these commands to administer the system.

318
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:05,220
Some of them are managing users or managing some network configuration, etc.

319
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:11,580
And as I said, to execute these commands, we actually need super user privilege.

320
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:17,620
So one of these commands is add user, let's clear this up.

321
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,460
And let's do add user.

322
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:26,060
And this command actually takes a parameter, which is just a username.

323
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,100
Let's do admin.

324
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,860
And if I execute this, you see a warning that says only root may add a user or group to

325
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:43,460
the system, which means we can't execute that as an regular non root user, right?

326
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,780
Which we are logged in as now.

327
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:53,200
So to be able to do that from my nano user, what I can do is at the beginning, I can add

328
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,460
something called pseudo.

329
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:01,380
And this basically tells the system that I want to temporarily just for this one command

330
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,580
become a super user to be able to execute this command.

331
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:12,260
And now if I execute this, you see that it's asking me for my password.

332
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
I'm going to type that in.

333
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,940
So it's authenticating me.

334
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,300
And you see the output which is adding user admin.

335
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,980
So it has added the user with name admin.

336
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,900
It has added the user in that group and now is asking me for the password for that new

337
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
user.

338
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:37,060
Type in whatever password, submitter, and retype that.

339
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:42,620
Let's call it admin.

340
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,940
Leave all the defaults say yes.

341
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,460
And our admin user was created.

342
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,780
And if I check the contents of home directory, I should actually see a new folder that was

343
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:02,420
created for the admin user, which is empty for now, except for some hidden files.

344
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:07,140
So whenever you get this warning, or you know that you're executing a command that needs

345
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,140
use a privilege, you can add pseudo at the beginning.

346
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:17,780
And it tells the system that you want to become super user for that one specific commit.

347
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:23,820
And know that once you authenticate yourself with the password, it's going to save that

348
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,480
authentication data.

349
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,740
So if I execute another command with pseudo, it will not ask for my password again, which

350
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,620
is obviously convenient because you don't want to type in password every time you want

351
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,740
to execute a command with pseudo.

352
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:47,420
So for example, if I did a group here, and let's call this DevOps group, you see that

353
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,020
it created the group without asking for a password.

354
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:56,380
Now obviously, because we have another user now, we could log into our operating system

355
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:02,900
with admin user and its password, the same way we can actually switch the user in the

356
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,900
command line terminal as well.

357
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:12,220
So now if I wanted to log in as an admin user my session, so switch from Nana to admin

358
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:21,300
in my terminal, I can do as you dash and name of the user I want to switch to.

359
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:27,180
And this will ask me for password of the admin user, because I'm trying to log in as one.

360
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,020
And set that in.

361
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:37,740
And you see that right here, if I do PWD, I'm inside slash home slash admin.

362
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:43,940
And again, I can switch back to my user like this.

363
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:49,060
And now it's asking me for Nana users password.

364
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:55,300
And they go again, very convenient if you want to or if you need to switch between users

365
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,940
on one computer, you don't have to log out and log in, you basically just do everything

366
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,940
in the terminal.

367
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:07,580
And the final interesting small detail here is that if I close the terminal and open it

368
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:16,620
again, I still have my history of the commands that I executed here history.

369
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:25,140
And the same way using these arrows, I can basically navigate to my old commands.

370
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:34,460
And once I close the terminal, all these actually got stored in bash history file.

371
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,620
And we want to display the contents of the file.

372
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:44,900
And all the commands are right here again, pretty useful if you want to remember what

373
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:50,980
you actually did on the system, and what commands you executed.

374
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:56,180
So these were basics of command line interface and Linux commands.

375
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,180
This should give you a really good foundational knowledge about how to work with the command

376
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,700
line interface.

377
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,460
And in the next sections, we're going to build on that knowledge and learn even more commands

378
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,700
and more concepts.
