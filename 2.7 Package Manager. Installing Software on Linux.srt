00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,360
In this lecture, we're going to talk about how to install software applications on Linux.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,680
In Windows, you would usually go to a download page of the application and download the installer,

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,720
which will take you through the installation steps using some installation wizard, and

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,520
that's how you usually install an application.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,640
In Linux, you could do the same, but it's absolutely not a recommended way of doing

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
it.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,800
And on Linux, we install most of the software using a package manager tool.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,480
There are exceptions, and we will see them, but probably 90% of software you're going

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,600
to install will be available through your package manager.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,960
And that's how you will install them.

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,800
So to understand how installing applications on Linux using a package manager works, let's

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,960
first understand what is a package manager and what is a software package.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,840
A software package is a compressed archive that contains all the files that are required

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,880
by a specific software to run, but software applications usually have dependencies.

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,920
So they depend on other software to run.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,880
For example, if you want to install and run Firefox, Firefox actually needs lots of different

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,480
other software to run properly, which are not directly packaged in the Firefox package.

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,360
So you need to install all those dependencies in order to be able to run Firefox.

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,200
Also we learned that installing software on Linux is more complicated because the files

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,200
are going to be spread across different folders, not like Windows where everything for one

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,320
application, all the files basically goes into one folder in program files.

22
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,880
So on Windows you can simply remove that program folder and all these configuration files and

23
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,640
everything will be gone.

24
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,040
Well in Linux you can do that, so you can just remove that program by deleting the files

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,440
because you don't know where all the program files are located because they have been just

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,280
spread across multiple folders.

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,280
So that's why we need a package manager to install that software package on your Linux

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
system.

29
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,360
So the package manager will actually resolve the dependencies for you.

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,720
Again with the example of Firefox, first it will find and fetch Firefox package and it

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,560
will see when installing Firefox that maybe needs 100 other packages and it will go and

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,760
find those 100 software packages and install them as well.

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,520
If these 100 packages have their own dependencies it will install them too.

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,920
Super convenient for you as a Linux user because you don't have to manage and resolve those

35
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,080
dependencies yourself.

36
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,000
In addition to that package manager will know where to put different files from the packages,

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,840
where to put the binary files for the application, shared files, libraries, dependencies etc.

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,720
So when you uninstall the software using package manager again it will clean up everything

39
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,040
because it knows where to put stuff so it will just delete them from all those places.

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,440
Now let's say you have an old version of a software and you want to update it.

41
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,440
Using a package manager in this case is also great because you don't have to uninstall

42
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,240
the old version of the software and install a new one like on Windows for example.

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,560
You can just use a command of the package manager to update the software.

44
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,960
So it will do all that's needed in the background automatically.

45
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Great!

46
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,020
Now you're probably thinking where do you get that package manager or what does it actually

47
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,020
look like?

48
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,720
Well in every Linux distribution you have a package manager already bundled in.

49
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,080
So when you install the operating system like Ubuntu you have a package manager already

50
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,560
available.

51
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,060
In Ubuntu's system which we are using we have a package manager called apt-apt which stands

52
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,440
for advanced package tool and this is a very popular package manager that you will see

53
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,920
in many other distributions as well.

54
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,600
And apt package manager has commands you can use to install, uninstall or upgrade the applications

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,360
on your system.

56
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,040
So now that we know why a package manager is useful in Linux and that we have a package

57
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,800
manager called apt available let's see how it actually works.

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,600
So first of all we use the package manager in our command line interface.

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,600
So if I type apt here you see that we have apt command available and here you see all

60
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,240
the actions that you can execute using the apt command.

61
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,960
So first of all a very convenient way to look up a package using your package manager

62
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,320
tool is apt search and the name of the package.

63
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,720
In this example we are going to install Java on our Ubuntu system so that we can use it

64
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
later in the bootcamp.

65
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:31,680
And this is going to be an openJDK Java development kit that's what we want to install and the

66
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,840
search will basically show us all the versions and all the available packages we can install

67
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,120
using the package manager tool.

68
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:47,280
However we will have to execute this using a sudo command and execute and there you go.

69
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,400
Here we see the packages for openJDK and different versions here.

70
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,040
What you could also do and this is actually very convenient in Ubuntu systems is if you

71
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,400
type in a command that belongs to the package that you want to install and execute you will

72
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:14,080
see a list of suggestions or suggested packages that you can install that basically has this

73
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,600
command.

74
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,040
And we're going to grab one of them.

75
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:27,640
I'm actually going to grab openJDK version 17, copy it with shift control C and then

76
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:33,840
paste in with shift control V and let's execute this.

77
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:41,240
So we have apt install name, the exact name of the package that we want to install and

78
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,160
again with sudo.

79
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,880
And this command basically makes a lookup of the package and the dependencies and it

80
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,640
shows you what will be installed and then you can basically confirm that we are okay

81
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,440
with the results and we want to install that awesome.

82
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,800
So now if I do Java again, you see that the command is already available and let's do

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,720
Java version and openJDK version 17 was installed.

84
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:20,840
So that's how easy it is to install different software using a package manager tool.

85
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:29,800
And we can also uninstall a software using apt remove command and the name of the package.

86
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,000
Again, it will ask for a confirmation for what will be removed.

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,880
And to completely remove version 17, we must also uninstall openJDK 11, which was installed

88
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,120
as a dependency during the installation.

89
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,720
You will use the same remove command, but this time type 11 as the version.

90
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,000
And that's it.

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,240
And now Java command is not available anymore.

92
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,360
So the big advantage of a package manager is that you have one central place from which

93
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,000
you query, install, update or uninstall, remove your applications.

94
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,200
To your package manager knows and keeps track of the state of each installed software for

95
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,600
you.

96
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,880
In the same way you can install Docker, Docker compose, npm or node and any other tools that

97
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:34,000
we will use in this bootcamp.

98
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,080
Now there is another package manager called apt get that you will often come across in

99
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,680
articles or installation guides, et cetera.

100
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,760
And as its name is very close to apt or apt, it may be confusing because you may wonder

101
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,680
what is the difference between the two, or maybe you can use them interchangeably.

102
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:06,080
And if I do apt get here, you see that we have apt get also available on our Ubuntu system.

103
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,400
And it has a different set of commands.

104
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:17,640
However, the same way you can also use it to install, update and uninstall applications.

105
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,000
So what is the difference between apt and apt get?

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Well apt is actually more user friendly than apt get.

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,040
So when you install an application or when you query an application, it gives you a much

108
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,160
user friendlier or much cleaner output than apt get.

109
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:42,120
And the apt search command that we use to look up a package that search command or query

110
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,720
command is not available in apt get.

111
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,360
So that means that if you have both available, you should be using apt because it's user

112
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,520
friendlier.

113
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,880
And it is actually available out of the box as I said bundled with the distribution in

114
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,360
more recent Linux distributions.

115
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,840
And to see the difference between apt and apt get when installing Java, for example,

116
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:11,120
in terms of user friendly output, let's actually install Java using apt get.

117
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:18,720
So apt get install name of the package and again pseudo.

118
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,480
So as you see, this is the same exact command just with apt get instead of apt.

119
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:33,920
And if I execute this, you have more specific output plus you don't have this progress bar

120
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,080
at the end that you have with Java.

121
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:47,400
So that's basically the main difference between apt and apt get package managers in a nutshell.

122
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,440
Great so we've seen how to use apt package manager to install packages, but where do

123
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,640
those packages actually come from?

124
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,240
Where does the package manager find the software we want to install and where does it find

125
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,680
all its dependencies that it also installs?

126
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,880
And these packages are files, right?

127
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,880
So they need to be stored somewhere.

128
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:18,800
Linux uses repositories, which are like warehouses of hundreds or thousands of software packages.

129
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,440
So each distribution like Ubuntu, for example, will have repositories that has most of the

130
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,400
software that you'll need.

131
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,640
And that's where the package manager gets these software packages from.

132
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,680
These repositories can be local, but mostly they're hosted online.

133
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,600
So the package manager can access them over the internet.

134
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,560
And usually on a fresh new operating system that we just installed, before you start installing

135
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:58,880
packages on your system, the first command that you should execute is actually apt update.

136
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,800
And this command, what it actually does is it refreshes the state of the repositories that

137
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,160
the distribution is using to get the latest versions of the applications to update the

138
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,040
cache, etc.

139
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,920
And this will usually also give you a summary of all the packages that have newer versions

140
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,320
in the repositories that you can actually upgrade.

141
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,400
Now there are a couple of official repositories that a distribution and the package manager

142
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,800
will use.

143
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:41,320
And these repositories are actually stored for apt package manager inside slash etc, which

144
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:49,040
if you remember is a folder that holds the system configuration files, as well as configurations

145
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,320
for different applications that you have on the system.

146
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,240
And we have a folder for apt.

147
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:05,520
And if we list the contents inside, we have sources dot list file.

148
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,240
And since everything is file in linux, we can just print the contents like this.

149
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:20,360
So this is a file that contains all the repositories that your apt package manager will use to

150
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,840
find the packages and to fetch them from.

151
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:32,960
And as I said, these repositories are available online, so you have the URLs of those repositories.

152
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,680
And that's how we installed Java and that's how you can install Docker, Docker compose,

153
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:46,640
npm and other tools from those official repositories.

154
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:54,040
And this will be mostly the way you install packages on your linux system.

155
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,080
However, there are exceptions when you can't install a certain software like this.

156
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:28,520
And this often happens because Ubuntu, like other distributions, have a procedure to verify

157
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:34,840
and approve a software package and every new version of the package before including it

158
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,640
into the official repositories.

159
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,640
And this verification and approval process may take days or weeks.

160
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,280
And if you don't want to wait for that, or if you need the latest version of some software

161
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,520
for your project, then you can't install it from there.

162
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:59,160
It could also be that Ubuntu just doesn't include a certain software packages in its

163
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,200
official repositories at all.

164
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Examples for that could be some browsers or maybe code editors like Visual Studio Code

165
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,240
or IntelliJ.

166
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,040
So what is the alternative here if you can't install a software like this?

167
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,560
Well, for this type of cases, you have actually multiple alternatives.

168
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,440
And we're going to see some of them here.

169
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:31,560
Let's say you want to install an IntelliJ program on your Ubuntu operating system, because

170
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,480
maybe you're going to be writing some program and you need a code editor or integrated development

171
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,000
environment for that.

172
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,160
So one very easy way to install applications that are not available in the official repo

173
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,720
is using Ubuntu software application.

174
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,800
If I click on it and open, first of all, you have a tab that shows you all the installed

175
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,840
software that you can also remove using this view.

176
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,360
And in Explorer, you can search for new packages.

177
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,080
In our example, we're looking for an IntelliJ editor.

178
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:17,320
And if I type that in, you'll see IntelliJ community, the paid one, et cetera.

179
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,200
So you have all these options here.

180
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,600
And if I click on the community, the free version that we're going to use, you have

181
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,720
this super convenient install button.

182
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:34,840
And if I click on this, again, we're installing a software so you need authentication so that

183
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,320
not everyone can do that.

184
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,320
And this will just start installing the application locally.

185
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,440
And here you see the version that you're installing so you can actually choose between different

186
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,800
applications.

187
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:54,840
So now we have IntelliJ installed locally and the same way you can remove it from here.

188
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,120
And if you wanted to access your installed software now, let's close this.

189
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:12,360
And in the applications or show applications, if we type in IntelliJ, here is our application.

190
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,920
So that's one alternative for installing different applications.

191
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:24,480
Another one is using another package manager tool, which is actually a newer package manager

192
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,320
for Linux, which is called SNAP.

193
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:35,160
And SNAP is basically a software packaging and deployment system for operating systems

194
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,920
that use Linux kernels.

195
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:47,120
And if I type in SNAP here in my Ubuntu operating system, you see that we have SNAP also available

196
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
by default.

197
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,040
So this one also comes bundled with the operating system distribution.

198
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:00,240
And with SNAP, we can also install, remove software and execute some other commands.

199
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,440
And you will actually see installation guide for different applications like IntelliJ as

200
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,760
well or Visual Studio Code, which is another code editor.

201
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,960
You will see the installation guides for these tools with SNAP command.

202
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,320
So what makes SNAP different from installing applications using app is that it uses these

203
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,400
self-contained packages.

204
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,480
So basically package where all the dependencies are already packaged inside and everything

205
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,920
that you need to run that application is basically in one full package.

206
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,560
So all these files that application needs is in one compressed file, and the format

207
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,280
of that file is also called SNAP.

208
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,280
And here you can see one of the examples from Visual Studio Code, which again is another

209
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
editor.

210
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,920
You see an example with SNAP, we're installing it with SNAP.

211
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,840
And you can also use SNAP to install IntelliJ, for example.

212
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,560
So let's execute the SNAP command to install Visual Studio Code now.

213
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,960
So sudo snap install code.

214
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,720
So this is the name of Visual Studio Code, SNAP package.

215
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:23,000
And if I execute and enter my password, this will install Visual Studio Code in the same

216
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:32,240
way to validate that there you go, we see Visual Studio Code icon here in our applications.

217
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,160
And for some applications, you may have both SNAP and app commands available to install

218
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
them.

219
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:48,440
For example, if I do Docker, you see that you can install them either using SNAP or app.

220
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,080
Now obviously, the question is what is the difference and which one you should use.

221
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:02,520
So the main difference between these two tools is that the SNAP packages are, as I mentioned,

222
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,720
self-contained, everything is packaged inside dependencies and everything that the application

223
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:14,800
needs is in a SNAP package, and it will be installed as one unified application.

224
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,720
EPD, however, has this split of different files, right?

225
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:26,000
The binaries and libraries, as we saw previously in the file system lecture, everything will

226
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,320
be distributed and stored separately.

227
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,160
So that's the main difference.

228
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,600
And that's how usually the applications should be installed on Linux.

229
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,160
So when you have these alternative, you should always go with EPD package manager and use

230
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,280
that instead.

231
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:48,640
But to mention some of SNAP's advantages, it supports universal Linux packages.

232
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,600
So it's not specific to a distribution and you can use it across different Linux distributions.

233
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,560
So that's an advantage.

234
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:03,800
And also it refreshes and updates the applications that it manages automatically.

235
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,800
On the downside, however, because everything is packaged inside this one package for each

236
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:16,120
application, of course, the SNAP files are much bigger, so they need much more space

237
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,520
to download and install.

238
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:24,560
And that means if you install 50 applications that share the dependencies, these dependencies

239
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,920
will be downloaded multiple times for each application because each one comes bundled

240
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,000
with its own dependency.

241
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,400
As with EPD, this will be managed better.

242
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,960
So if applications share the dependencies, EPD will download this dependency once and

243
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,760
it will know when installing the next tool that needs the dependencies, it will basically

244
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,320
know that dependency is already there and it will not re-download that.

245
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,600
So basically SNAP doesn't use the storage resource as efficiently as EPD and it also

246
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,560
doesn't install applications in a way which is common for Linux.

247
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,880
So when you have these two options, you should always use EPD package manager and SNAP is

248
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,360
basically an alternative if you can't install a certain package using EPD.

249
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:20,280
And going back to the Ubuntu software application from which we installed IntelliJ, we have

250
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,240
a dropdown with different versions here that we can choose from.

251
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,560
If I click inside, you see that each version has a format SNAP and it comes from a SNAP

252
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
store.

253
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:39,440
So basically this is like a front-end or user interface of SNAP tool that we just use on

254
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,000
a command line interface to install Visual Studio Code.

255
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:52,120
So this under the hood uses the same SNAP command that we used.

256
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:59,280
And another way of installing applications that I want to show you is adding another

257
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,040
repository to this official repositories list that Ubuntu has or a Linux distribution like

258
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,960
Ubuntu has and then installing the package from there.

259
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,360
And the reason why I want to show you that option as well is because you will encounter

260
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:23,880
that option for example when installing relatively new applications or new tools that are not

261
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:30,400
in the official repositories yet, especially if you're working on an older version of operating

262
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,120
system and in an installation guide you will see the steps where you have to first add

263
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,720
a repository that contains the package that you're looking for and then basically install

264
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,160
the package from there.

265
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:52,120
So when you add the repository, it will be automatically added to the sources.list file

266
00:23:52,120 --> 00:24:00,920
which is in the apt configuration folder under slash etc slash apt and once the repository

267
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:07,640
is on the list there you can use apt package manager to install packages also from the

268
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,760
repository.

269
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,440
So now when you execute apt install command it will search for that package in all the

270
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,880
repositories that are configured on your system and when it finds that package it will basically

271
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,680
just fetch it from there.

272
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:28,520
And some of these repositories that you add to your system are personal package archive

273
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,600
repositories, also called PPAs.

274
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:40,600
So PPA is basically a repository that allows application developers or private users basically

275
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:47,960
to create their own repository for Linux systems and then distribute the software through that

276
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
repository.

277
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,040
Again if there is a tool that is super cutting edge and that is not in most of the official

278
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,120
repositories but they of course want to make it available to the users they may create

279
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:07,560
this personal repository and host that application there so you can download it and install it

280
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,760
from there.

281
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:17,200
Now note that PPAs as the name suggests personal package archive these are personal repositories

282
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,920
so they are not verified by the Linux distribution that you are using.

283
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:30,400
So you should be very selective when adding the PPAs to your system and verify yourself

284
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:39,160
who this repository belongs to who is maintaining it etc.

285
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:47,160
So these are some of the common ways of installing software on Linux where the first option

286
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,280
which you should always use if possible and this is actually what we use most of the time

287
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:00,280
when installing software on Linux which is the package manager like Ept that fetches

288
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,280
packages from the official package repositories.

289
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,800
So that will be the first option for 80 to 90% of the cases.

290
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,440
If that is not possible then we have alternative and the first alternative that you should

291
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,480
use is SNAP of course if it's available on your system and using SNAP you can really

292
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,880
easily download and install different software and if none of them is an option sometimes

293
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,320
you may have to add additional repository to your system so that your package manager

294
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,920
can fetch software packages from there.

295
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Now we saw how to install applications in software on Ubuntu operating system using

296
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:55,880
Ept package manager and some alternatives but Ubuntu is just one of the Linux distributions

297
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,560
and there are hundreds of other distributions out there.

298
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:06,640
Now do they all use the same package manager like Ept or does each have their own or how

299
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,840
does it work with other distributions?

300
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,480
All these hundreds of distributions can actually be grouped into categories if they are based

301
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:24,200
on same source code and these distributions in the same category will use the same package

302
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,680
manager.

303
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:32,120
There are two most used and known categories of Linux distributions which are Debian based

304
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:42,680
distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint which all use Ept or EptGet and the

305
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:51,440
second one is Redhead based distributions such as RHEL or RHEL which stands for Redhead

306
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,200
Enterprise Linux.

307
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,000
We also have CentOS which is also Redhead based or Fedora.

308
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,120
We have other distributions as well in the same categories but these are some of the

309
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:09,160
most known ones and most commonly used ones and Redhead based distributions actually use

310
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:15,200
a different package manager called YUM and throughout the bootcamp we will be working

311
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:22,520
with different remote servers where we will use both Ept and YUM package managers.

312
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,440
So you will see examples of both in our later projects as well.

313
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:33,160
And even though these are two different package managers on two different categories of distributions

314
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,640
the concept is very similar.

315
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:43,040
So you have this package manager that uses the official repositories that are configured

316
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:49,800
for the system like CentOS or Fedora or RHEL and basically fetching packages from there

317
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:55,000
and installing them on the system by resolving all the dependencies.

318
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,680
However, there could be differences in the repositories that the distributions are using

319
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:09,160
such as some repositories will have more packages available than others, some will have newer

320
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,840
versions of applications than others etc.

321
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,520
So the package manager tool and the repositories that different distributions are using or

322
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:26,600
different categories of Linux distributions are using is usually one of the main differentiators

323
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,360
when deciding which distribution to choose.

324
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,640
So system administrators for example who configure the servers may decide which Linux distribution

325
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,600
they install based on the package manager tool they prefer.

326
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,440
However, within the same category the difference between the distributions is essentially very

327
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:55,880
small mostly it's the desktop environment and visuals which you can also change and adjust.

328
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,080
So now you know what package managers are and you know how to install applications in

329
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,000
Linux distributions and we saw some examples on Ubuntu.

330
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,920
We have one main way of installing software on Linux and some alternatives for rest of

331
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:20,440
the cases and we also saw that distributions are actually categorized based on which package

332
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,120
manager tool they use.
