1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
In this lecture, you will learn one of the core concepts in Linux and generally operating

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,560
systems, which is operating system users and their permissions.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,880
We will see Linux commands for creating users and groups as well as understand how permissions

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,560
work and how to give users and groups in Linux different permissions to work with files and

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,000
do things on the system.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,280
First of all, there are three categories of users that we may have on a Linux system.

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,580
First one is the root user.

8
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:48,960
This is a special type of user that has unrestricted access and permissions to the whole system.

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,760
Also called a super user, because it can do anything.

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,320
Whether you want to do some administrative tasks or access restricted files, for example,

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:06,120
on your system, you need to log in as a root user or you need to execute commands as a

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
root user.

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,600
A second type of user are regular or standard users.

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,240
These are the users that we create to log in to the system.

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:24,040
So if I want to use a computer or a server, I will have some standard user that I can

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,280
use to log into the system and then do stuff there.

17
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,640
And each regular or standard user will have its own dedicated space that we already saw

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,720
in the slash home directory in a folder that has the same name as that user.

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,160
And the third type is service user.

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:51,400
The service user is relevant on Linux server distributions, because Linux is widely used

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:59,480
for servers and servers run different services, like a database server or a web application

22
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,200
server, etc.

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,720
And it can run multiple of those services.

24
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,200
So you may have an Apache server application running on a server, as well as MySQL database,

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
etc.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,080
And each such service or application will actually get its own user.

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,760
So they will not be started by a standard user or a root user, but rather they will

28
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,200
have a dedicated, for example, MySQL user or Apache user that will start the application.

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Why?

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,440
Because this makes sure that each application is isolated in terms of permissions from each

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,400
other and ensures better security.

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:46,480
And this is a best practice in server management and DevOps to run the services with their

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,440
own dedicated user running a service with a root user is very bad because this will

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,200
create a lot of security issues.

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,760
So no service should be run with root user because then that service will get actually

36
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,920
root user privileges.

37
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,560
And it may accidentally disrupt the system, or if someone would hack into our system and

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,160
that application, specifically, they will be able to do more damage to the whole system

39
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,280
with a root user privilege.

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,760
So these are the three types of users that you will have on a system.

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,080
And on one machine, you may have multiple of those users.

42
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,600
You always have one root user obviously per computer or server, but you may have multiple

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,400
regular users in addition and multiple service users.

44
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,240
Now why do we need multiple standard user accounts, for example, on one machine?

45
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:52,160
Let's say we have a personal laptop or computer that use at work or university.

46
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,360
Why would you need multiple accounts?

47
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,840
Well, the main reason is to be able to share your computer.

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,640
For example, many companies use Windows operating system for personal computers or laptops that

49
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,680
the employees would use.

50
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,640
And each personal computer or laptop can actually be accessed by any of the employees.

51
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,760
So if you change your hardware, if you change your laptop in the company, you will still

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,360
be able to access that laptop.

53
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,720
You will be able to log in with your user.

54
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,120
Same thing at universities.

55
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,640
And universities have computer labs that can be accessed with computers, and each computer

56
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,200
can be accessed by any student in the university with their own personal login credentials.

57
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,120
So how does this work?

58
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,400
Does every computer have a copy of all the accounts?

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,120
Well, for Windows, and that is actually a difference between Windows and Linux, Windows

60
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,800
has a possibility to centrally manage the users.

61
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,440
So the administrators at Workspace or the university, they will usually configure a

62
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,360
system with a list of all the students or all the employees with the user accounts

63
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,960
for each one of them, and then all the computers will be connected to the system.

64
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,440
So whenever someone tries to log in to a computer at work, for example, then the operating system

65
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:29,200
will ask that centrally managed system, hey, there is this user that is trying to log in,

66
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,960
please check the credentials and give an access if the credentials are correct, or if you

67
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
have that kind of user.

68
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,720
So when you log in to such computer, you will see your home folder, and that's it.

69
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,520
You don't have access to restricted folders or system folders, and you will have no access

70
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,000
to other users' folders, so everything is nicely isolated.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,520
And depending on permissions, if the permissions are strict, you may not be able to change

72
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,720
anything outside your home directory.

73
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,560
For example, you will not be able to just install software on your computer, because

74
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,440
as we saw, these installation files end up outside your home directory.

75
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,400
So in Windows systems, the centrally managed user permissions allows you as an employee,

76
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,480
for example, to log into any hardware, any computer that is connected to the system at

77
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,080
work, and basically see your home directory with all the files and everything that you

78
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,040
have there, and continue working from there so you're not tied to the hardware.

79
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,960
But as I said, this is specific to Windows, and Linux actually doesn't have that capability.

80
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:44,080
That's one of the reasons why in many companies or universities, Windows is used as an operating

81
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
system.

82
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,520
However, on Linux machines, you still have a possibility to register multiple users.

83
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,360
However, these users will be managed on that specific hardware, that specific computer.

84
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,200
If you're logging on another computer, you're going to have users that are registered on

85
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,480
that specific computer.

86
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,120
So it's different from one computer to another.

87
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,640
And again, this is a use case if you want to share the same computer with many users,

88
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
for example.

89
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:25,160
In Linux, however, this multiple user accounts is more relevant when we're talking about

90
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:33,760
servers, because usually servers are managed by teams of administrators or engineers.

91
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,680
So multiple people need access to the same servers.

92
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:45,040
Now you may be asking, why can't all the team members just have one account, or one user,

93
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,160
and then basically access the server with that user?

94
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,840
So have a shared user, basically, instead of having their personal files.

95
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,960
Because it's a server, so they're just going to be managing some services there anyways.

96
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,200
Well, let's say an example of why giving each team member their own user is actually important.

97
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,760
Let's say we have two servers in the company maintained by a system administrator's team

98
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,320
of three people.

99
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,160
First of all, you don't want to give them all root password, right?

100
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,960
So they need to have a non-root user.

101
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,520
Because again, root user should be just used by the system, and whenever you need to access

102
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,480
a restricted file or do something that needs a super user privilege.

103
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,280
But other than that, you should be always working with a non-root user.

104
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,840
Also, you can decide per team member what permissions they get.

105
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,240
Because someone may be a senior administrator, another person may be a junior.

106
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,960
So they may actually get less privileges and less permissions to change stuff on the system

107
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,040
or to access certain locations.

108
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:01,400
Also, with multiple people working on the server, you want to track who did what on the system.

109
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,320
So you want the traceability on the system.

110
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,840
Because if it's an important server, like a production server, for example, and you want to know what happened

111
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:19,000
by which user at a specific time, not for blaming, but just knowing who can help resolve that issue.

112
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,240
So these are the reasons why you would want to give each team member their own user accounts

113
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,680
to work on servers.

114
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,120
So when you get a fresh new server, an admin will usually create those users.

115
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,920
So that the team members have access to it.

116
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:42,160
And in the next section, we're going to see how creating users and giving them permissions actually works.

117
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,440
Now, how do we manage permissions for users on Linux systems?

118
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,600
We can manage permissions on two different levels.

119
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,000
The first one is we can give permissions to users directly.

120
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,680
So we can say a new user, Nana, will have a permission to install applications on the system.

121
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,560
She will have a permission to execute commands with super user privilege, etc.

122
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,520
So we can do that per user.

123
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:25,120
Another way of managing user permissions is by grouping users into Linux groups

124
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,280
and then giving that group certain permissions.

125
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:35,120
And this is actually the best way of doing it, especially if you're managing multiple users

126
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,760
by defining a group on a Linux system.

127
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:46,280
For example, if you have a DevOps team, then you would have DevOps group or you may have an admin group.

128
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,760
You may also have a group for developers.

129
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:57,440
And then you would add all those users to the group and then you would have permissions defined for that group

130
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
and not directly for the user.

131
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:06,880
And this is actually super convenient and way easier to manage if you have tens or hundreds of users.

132
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,680
If you have 50 users, you don't want to set permission for each one of them one by one.

133
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,520
And then when they're not in the team anymore, then take permissions from them and so on.

134
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,960
Way easier is to just add the user to the group.

135
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,280
So we'll get all the permissions that the group has and then remove the user from the group

136
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,640
and it will lose all the permissions that it had from the group.

137
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,520
And that's why usually when we're working with users, we also work with groups.

138
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:43,720
So each user will be part of a group by default and then you can add a user to multiple groups even.

139
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,560
So they will get all the permissions from all the groups that they are part of.

140
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,240
And this is actually a very important concept in Linux systems.

141
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:02,120
So now that we know all this theoretically, let's actually see how managing users and groups on Linux actually works in practice.

142
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:14,240
So back on our Ubuntu system, where we're going to see how to create new users and how to give them permissions.

143
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:22,800
First of all, let's see where all the users that the system has is actually stored and how we can access that list.

144
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,520
That information is actually stored in slashetc slash password file.

145
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:34,320
And since it's a file, we can just print the contents of the file.

146
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,160
Again, if you remember, slashetc is the system configuration location.

147
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,000
And that's where we have the users that are registered on the system.

148
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,680
So if I print the contents, you see this not very user friendly list.

149
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,280
However, it's not very complex.

150
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:04,240
Actually, each line here represents a user like this one right here, which is my user that I created.

151
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,800
And let's see what all this information actually means.

152
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,760
First of all, we have the name of the user, then we have X.

153
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,400
And you see that there is X for all the other users.

154
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,200
And this is actually a placeholder for the user's password.

155
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,800
Obviously, it's not displayed here in plain text because it's a password, it's a sensitive data.

156
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,640
So we just see a placeholder X.

157
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,600
The password itself is actually stored in another file for security.

158
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,640
Then we have a number here that actually represents the unique ID of the user.

159
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:46,160
So my user, Nana has ID of 1000 and root user on the system always has an ID of zero.

160
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,200
The second number that we see here is the primary group ID for that user.

161
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,880
So groups also have their IDs and each user will have a primary group,

162
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,800
which that user is part of and that primary group ID will be stored here as well.

163
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,080
Then we have the user description and full name, etc.

164
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:16,120
This is the user's home directory and this is user's default shell,

165
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:25,280
slash bin slash pesh, which is actually the shell that we're using here to execute different commands.

166
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,400
And as I said, this is a file.

167
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,840
So how do we add a new user?

168
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,480
It's actually pretty easy.

169
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,160
We already saw that command add user and username.

170
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,000
And let's call this one Tom.

171
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,760
However, adding a user in a system is administrative task.

172
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,200
So we are going to need super user privilege here.

173
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:57,280
And if I execute and enter my password, this will create a new user.

174
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:03,400
And we have to set the initial password for the user

175
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:15,120
and the full name, room name, whatever.

176
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,520
And confirm.

177
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:25,200
And again, if we now print out the list of users, we should see Tom right here.

178
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,880
And this information that we entered, they're all listed here comma separated.

179
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,920
And Tom also got its own user ID.

180
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,800
And this is the primary group ID of the user.

181
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,200
Now, where does this primary group actually come from?

182
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,160
Well, whenever we create a user using user add by default,

183
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:55,000
it also creates a group with the same name as the user and sets that as a primary group ID

184
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,920
of the user.

185
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,120
So this is the group called Tom and its ID here.

186
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,560
And that's the default behavior.

187
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:14,640
You can also change the password of a user using password command and username.

188
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,320
And of course, this is also an administrative task.

189
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,160
And now we can set a new password.

190
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,720
And there you go.

191
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,200
Password updated.

192
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,280
Now we could actually log out from the virtual machine and log in as Tom user.

193
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,320
Or we can do that directly on the command line as well.

194
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:50,200
Using command SU dash and username that we want to log in as and their password.

195
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,400
And right here, as you see, we're logged in as Tom user.

196
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:05,240
This is just a name of the computer, but we are in Tom's home directory right now.

197
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:14,480
And the same way we can switch back to my user like this.

198
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:21,200
Using the same command, you can actually log in to the system as a root user.

199
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,120
So without specifying any username here by default, this will be root.

200
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,720
So SU dash will log you in as a root user.

201
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,800
Of course, you will have to specify the password of the root user.

202
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,920
Now let's say we want to create a new group called DevOps, where all our team members

203
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,480
or engineers will be added.

204
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,520
And then we can add the permission to that DevOps group instead of adding permission

205
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,400
individually to each user.

206
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,360
So how can we add a group?

207
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,040
Also super easy, sudo group add and the group name.

208
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,000
And we're going to add a new group called DevOps.

209
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,520
And of course, if you want to verify the group was added, we can print the list of

210
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:19,440
groups from slash etc slash group file.

211
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
And there you go.

212
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,640
At the end, we have the name of the group and the ID of the group, a small note here

213
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,400
on the commands for creating users and groups.

214
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,280
If you noticed, I used a command add user to create a user, and group add to create

215
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,520
a group.

216
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,000
So basically in most Linux distributions, we have the following command pairs when creating

217
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,080
users or groups.

218
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:51,120
We have add user and user add, add group and group add.

219
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,440
And if you see examples with these commands on internet, it may get confusing.

220
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,720
So what is the difference here?

221
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:04,520
On most distributions, add user and add group are interactive, more user friendly options

222
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,480
of the commands user add and group add.

223
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,600
What does interactive and user friendly mean in this case, it's easier to use and all

224
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:20,800
the info you need to create a user or a group, like ID or home directory, etc, gets set automatically.

225
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Or it asks you for an input in interactive mode, like with password.

226
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:32,320
Whereas for user add and group add, you need to provide all the needed information as parameters,

227
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,080
since these are more low level commands.

228
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,320
So which one should you use?

229
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,760
As a rule of thumb, use user add group add commands in scripts when you are executing

230
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:52,000
these commands in an automated way, and use add user and add group commands when executing

231
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,720
them manually.

232
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:01,280
The same goes for user deal or delete and deal user as well as group del and del group

233
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,920
command pairs.

234
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,800
Now let's say we want to change the primary group of user Tom to DevOps.

235
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,560
How do we do that?

236
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,920
Using a command called user mod, which modifies or changes the user.

237
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:25,320
So we can do user mod minus or dash g, the primary group that we want the user to be

238
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,840
in and the username.

239
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:35,240
And if I execute this, this will make DevOps the primary group of user Tom.

240
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:42,440
And now since we don't need the Tom group anymore, we can remove it using del group

241
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,400
or group del command.

242
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:53,400
So we can do del group Tom, and this will remove the group called Tom.

243
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,280
Now we can add a user to multiple groups, right?

244
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,400
So in addition to one primary group, a user can have multiple secondary groups.

245
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:10,120
And as a result, user will get all the permissions that the groups have, which it belongs to.

246
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:19,360
To add a user to multiple secondary groups, we can use user mod dash capital G and then

247
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,920
list of the groups that we want the user to be added to.

248
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,480
So we can do admin and some other group here and username.

249
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,960
In our case, let's just add Tom to admin group.

250
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:40,040
But know that capital G option will override the whole secondary groups list.

251
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,320
So it always sets the new list of groups for the user.

252
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,720
If you want to add user to a new secondary group in addition to the existing ones it

253
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,520
already belongs to, we use an option A in addition.

254
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,800
So using this command, we can basically append a new group to the existing groups.

255
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,360
So as you see, Linux commands accept different options to change their default behavior,

256
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,920
which is an example with the user mod command.

257
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,480
But for other commands as well, like add user, add group, et cetera, you can use different

258
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,600
options to set a custom ID and change the defaults for the user or group when creating

259
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,680
them by adding options to the command.

260
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,080
You can check the documentation or what's called main pages or manual pages for any

261
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,000
Linux command to see all the options you can use with it.

262
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Great.

263
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,160
So we have added user to multiple groups.

264
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,600
How do we actually print out or see all the groups a user belongs to in an easy way?

265
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:53,640
Well, there's a command for that too called groups, which displays the groups that currently

266
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,200
logged in user belongs to.

267
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,800
But with groups username, like groups Tom, for example, we can display the groups of

268
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,360
any other user.

269
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:11,000
We can also log in as Tom user to Tom's account and display the groups there as well.

270
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:25,480
And if we switch to user Tom and groups, right here, you see that Tom is in DevOps and admin

271
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,640
groups.

272
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,600
And if you want to move back to the previous user, we can also do exit.

273
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:39,000
So this will log out to the user and I'm back in my previous users session.

274
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,560
We can also add users by specifying the group at the creation time instead of going through

275
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,000
all these steps.

276
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,400
So when adding a user user add command with a name like Nicole, for example, we can actually

277
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,680
specify the group right here.

278
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,480
Let's say this is the DevOps group.

279
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,480
So this will add Nicole user to DevOps group.

280
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,760
However, it will still create a default group with the same name.

281
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:24,800
So if we check now the users list, we have a new user here with a primary group ID of

282
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,240
this group.

283
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,600
However, it's also added to the DevOps group.

284
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,440
Now if you want to remove a user from a group, for that you would execute a command called

285
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,880
g password.

286
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,680
And then you have a flag for delete user and the group.

287
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,480
So this will remove the user from the specified group.

288
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,160
I'm going to execute and we have removing username call from group DevOps.

289
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,000
And there you go.

290
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,720
So this is how you work with users and groups in Linux.

291
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,680
In the next part, we're going to see permissions for users and groups.
