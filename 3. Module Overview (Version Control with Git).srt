1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this module, you will learn about version control and one of its most popular implementations,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Git.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,280
Version control is used in software development to manage the application code, but it's

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,120
becoming more and more important in the DevOps space in order to manage the application configuration

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,840
as part of the infrastructure as code concept.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,400
So as a DevOps engineer, you should learn and know how to use Git.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,560
So first, we will look at the concepts of version control systems in general and then

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,080
specifically how Git works.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,800
We will create a simple Git repository on GitLab and work with it locally using the

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,080
Git command line interface.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,840
You will also learn all the relevant Git commands that you need when working with Git repository.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,720
I will also explain some useful concepts like reverting mistakes, resolving merge conflicts

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,720
and so on.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,560
In addition, we will look at the concepts of branches and learn how to work with them

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,200
using hands-on practical demos.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,800
And throughout the whole module, while learning all the different concepts, I will also explain

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,640
the best practices when working with Git.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,640
We will actually be using Git throughout the whole bootcamp in different modules for

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,440
different use cases.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,400
So by the end of the bootcamp, you will feel really comfortable using Git in your own projects.
