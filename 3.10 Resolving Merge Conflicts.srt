1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
So this time let's actually go to the editor locally.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:15,360
So let's go to the server.js and I'm going to change something here, right?

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,920
So now I have a change locally.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:29,320
So I can add those changes.

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,840
So I've committed my changes locally, now let's go to remote.

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,320
And now I'm going to edit the same line that I did locally right here, right?

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,600
So I have my local changes yet.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,280
So I can do changes in parallel, let's say for remote.

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,200
So I have edited exactly the same line, the same code place that I did locally.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,560
And this is something very realistic, two developers or even three developers can actually

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:07,320
change code in exactly the same place, exactly the same file in parallel without knowing.

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,840
And this will of course cause merge conflicts, right?

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,320
So I have changes on the remote.

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:21,480
So before I can actually push my local changes, I have to fetch that change first.

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,080
So now if I do git push, again, I see there are some changes locally.

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,960
So my push was rejected.

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:39,800
And if I do git pull rebase, here you see that I got conflict, git pull rebase.

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,080
This is all the information.

19
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,400
And here somewhere we see conflict, merge conflict in server.js.

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,080
So what happened is that merge wasn't possible because git doesn't know which version of

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,720
those two changes you actually want to take, right?

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,600
Both could be legitimate.

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,020
So it can automatically decide one or the other.

24
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:09,480
So you have to now manually decide which change actually stays and which one gets removed.

25
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,880
First let's see how that conflict actually looks like in the editor.

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,960
Here you also see that you are in a different state or different mode during the rebase

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,080
mode, but it's not completed.

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,520
So if I go back to editor, you see my conflict is actually highlighted here.

29
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,960
So the way you can do that easily, there are different editors and command lines for that.

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,960
You can do that in git clients with UI, you can do it in command line, or you can actually

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,160
do this in the editor, like IntelliJ.

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,600
This is what I prefer because you have good visualization of the conflict.

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:54,200
So what I do is in git resolve conflicts, you see a view, this is the changes locally

34
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,520
and these are the changes remotely.

35
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,440
And this is the end result.

36
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,920
So you basically have to decide what the end result will look like.

37
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,400
And usually the way this happens is, let's say this is from developer Emily and this

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,120
is your code changes.

39
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,680
So what you do is that you go to Emily and you ask, hey, we have a conflict here, can

40
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
we see what happened there?

41
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,800
So why did you change the code to this and then explain why you made those changes?

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,720
And at some point you agree on something and you decide, you know what, Emily's changes

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,400
were correct, or maybe both of our changes need to be merged, right?

44
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:40,460
So what you can do is pull this one in, so for remote and locally.

45
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,700
So now both of your changes are in there.

46
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,860
Let's actually remove this.

47
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,100
And this will be the end product.

48
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,100
So you and Emily agreed, you know what, both of our changes make sense.

49
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,820
So let's actually add them together and merge them like this.

50
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
And when you're done, you save.

51
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:07,620
And if you go back to editor and do get status, now git tells you what status you're in.

52
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,940
And here you see once you're done fixing all the conflicts, it could be more files than

53
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,900
just one in real case, it could be actually multiple files that all were changed.

54
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,740
And once you're done with that, you can actually run git rebase continue.

55
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,900
This is also something that is very helpful because whenever you have all these cases,

56
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,540
you can always type in git status and git tells you what status you're in, what is your current

57
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:41,380
state, and it also gives you suggestion what to do next based on your state, right?

58
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,420
So you can refer to this.

59
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,500
So I'm going to do git rebase continue.

60
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,180
And here you see this is my commit, and I'm in different mode now.

61
00:04:51,180 --> 00:05:03,260
So now I can actually push my change to remote and remote gets updated.

62
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:13,620
And here if I go back to files and server, I see for remote and locally.

63
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,620
So this is the resolved conflict.
