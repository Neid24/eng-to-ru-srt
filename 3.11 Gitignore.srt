1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Now, let's see something called .gitignore file in git repositories.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,120
So whenever we create a project and we initiate it as git repository, we can actually add

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,880
gitignore file.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:25,640
And what this file basically does is it excludes folders or files from the project from getting

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,240
checked into the remote repository.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,800
And these kind of files are something that, for example, is specific to your editor, right?

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,960
Something that other developers do not need to download in their own projects, right?

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,960
This is something specific for every developer, and it doesn't have to do anything with the

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,200
overall project.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,440
In my case, because I'm using IntelliJ, when I opened the project, IntelliJ automatically

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,320
created this .idea folder, right?

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,640
Now if my fellow developers are using visual code, for example, and not IntelliJ, they

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,200
obviously don't need this folder, right?

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,400
So this shouldn't be checked into the repository.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,040
Another example of folders that should be excluded is, for example, build folders.

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,240
Whenever you build your application, for example, if I start the application with IntelliJ,

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
it creates build folder, right?

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,080
And this build folder basically has the compiled files or transpiled files and some other generated

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:38,340
files that is important to run the application locally, but it shouldn't be part of the code.

20
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,920
So how do I exclude these files?

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,440
Using this .gitignore file.

22
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,520
So it is called .gitignore.

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,720
And here, basically, I can just list those files or folders.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,520
I can do .idea.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,920
So I want to exclude this folder.

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,000
If I had a build folder, for example, here, I would exclude that one as well.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,600
Now, before I created this gitignore, I actually checked in my whole code into the repository.

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,440
So I actually have this .idea already checked in.

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,040
So let's go back here and see, I have this one here.

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,120
So I want to remove .idea folder from the repository.

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
And I also want to remove the node modules folder.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Why?

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,320
Because these are dependencies that everyone should install locally from the package JSON.

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,740
So it shouldn't be in the remote repository, right?

35
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,920
Because this is needed for running the application and either locally or on production server.

36
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,120
And we don't need this as part of the code.

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,480
So I'm going to exclude that one as well.

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:58,880
And now, if I go to my command line and to git status, here you see gitignore file has

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,360
been added and changed.

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,440
But I also see the .idea workspace XML changed.

41
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,840
Now why is that?

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,360
Because we just excluded this .idea in the gitignore file, right?

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,800
So why do we see the changes in that folder to be committed?

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,840
The problem is that because we already committed this folder in the repository, git is tracking

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
it.

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,200
Meaning every change in that folder in any of the files is tracked by git and things

47
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,240
that we should now add that change and commit that change.

48
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,560
So we need to tell git, hey, forget about the folder.

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,880
We are not tracking that anymore.

50
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,440
We want to ignore that from any git activity.

51
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,180
And in order to do that, we have to remove it from git's cache, right?

52
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:01,360
So git, remove, recursive, cached.

53
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,040
And we can either say with dot or we can actually put the name of the folder.

54
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,120
And you see that everything inside idea folder was removed from the git cache.

55
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,280
And now if I do status, you see the git wants to remove that file from the remote repository.

56
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:31,480
So let's actually check everything in, edit gitignore file.

57
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,920
And if I commit or push this.

58
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,040
So now if I go back to the UI and choose the branch, because we made all those changes

59
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,120
in the branch, here you see the dot idea folder is gone.

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:57,440
Now we can do the same with node modules, git remove, cached node modules.

61
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,840
And if I do status, we need to remove that from the remote repository.

62
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,440
So actually, this was already added to commit.

63
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:21,640
So removed node modules from repo.

64
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,920
And if I push this and reload, the node modules are gone as well.

65
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,560
Of course, they stay in the local folder.

66
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,960
I have node modules and dot idea here, but they're not tracked anymore by git.

67
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,020
Because we have excluded them in gitignore.

68
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,480
But because I had already added them to the remote repository, I had to remove it from

69
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,680
cache so that git deleted it entirely, the old tracking as well.

70
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,680
And we can do the same with dot ds store file, which is a mechOS specific file that stores

71
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,120
some metadata about your local folder, basically.

72
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,520
So of course, it's not needed in code and doesn't need to be shared with other developers

73
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,720
in the team.

74
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,480
It's specific to your local environment.

75
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,120
So let's also add that to the gitignore file.

76
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,480
And since it's a file and not a directory, we just type the name of the file here.

77
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,960
Now I'm going to switch back to the terminal window.

78
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,400
And we're going to remove this file from the cache first, because it has already been committed

79
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,080
and pushed to the repository.

80
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,240
So we're going to remove that from cache and then commit our changes with the commit

81
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,520
message, removed ds store file, and let's push this.

82
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
Now I'm going to go back to the browser.

83
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,000
And if I refresh the page, we can see the file has also been removed from our remote

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,720
repository.

85
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,960
And as I said in most of the projects where you are working with some editor and you're

86
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,600
running application locally, you will get these generated folders like build and node

87
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,960
modules or dot idea or for Java, for example, some other generated folders.

88
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,160
So most of the projects you will need gitignore file.
