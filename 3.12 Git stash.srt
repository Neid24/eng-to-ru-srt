1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Let's see another use case where I have some changes in the feature branch or bug fix branch.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,920
Let's make some changes here, for example.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,480
Let's say I remove this line, so I have some local changes in this branch.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,080
So if I do status, I see the change here.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,640
So let's say I need to move to another branch, like a master branch or maybe some other feature

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,320
branch, but I don't want to commit those changes because it's not done yet.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:43,320
I'm in the work in progress state and these are just some changes that I'm playing around.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:52,360
So if I do git checkout master, it won't lend me because it says you have local changes.

9
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,040
So git doesn't know what to do with my local changes when I move to another branch.

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,600
A perfect use case for this could be, let's say I'm fixing a bug, for example, and I can't

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,920
reproduce it or I need some more information about how to test that bug.

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:16,200
So I decide to change to master branch to see how it works there with master branch's code

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,880
status, right?

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,040
But as you see, I can't just leave a branch if I have local changes, right?

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,720
So what I can do in this case is I can stash my changes.

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:37,640
So if I do git stash, it will take my working changes and it will hide them, so to say, right?

17
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,000
It will save it for later.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,520
So if I do git status now, I have no changes that are active or displayed.

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,480
So now I can check out another branch.

20
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,720
And let's say I do my testing here in master branch.

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,800
I see that it doesn't work in a master branch.

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,720
I see some differences and I want to continue with my code changes in the branch.

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,680
So again, I check out my bug fix branch.

24
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,280
My changes aren't here.

25
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,040
So how do I get my changes back from the stash?

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:23,520
I do git stash pop and here I get back my changes and I can continue.

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,640
Another use case for stashing your changes could be also in the same branch, actually.

28
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,720
So for example, let's say I have made some changes in the code and something isn't working.

29
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,840
Some other feature that I'm not even messing around with is not working anymore.

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:48,600
So I want to see, did I break that feature with my changes somehow accidentally or maybe

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,960
didn't work even before.

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:58,040
And to be sure, I can revert or I can hide my changes, my local code changes and test

33
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,720
the application to see if that feature works without my code changes.

34
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,520
And again, the way to do that is to stash my changes.

35
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,720
So all the code that I added or removed will be gone.

36
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,000
I can test if the feature worked before I did anything in the code and then I can bring

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,560
my changes back using git stash pop.

38
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,840
So this could be another scenario where you will need this comment.
