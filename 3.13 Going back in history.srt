00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,640
Another interesting concept in Git is history or the log of commits.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,200
So I have a bunch of commits that I have made in this branch.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,160
So I have a history of my activities.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:28,440
Now as you see here, each commit has this unique hash that identifies that specific

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,320
commit.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,800
And there are some cases where this commit hash, the unique hash is actually very useful.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:45,400
So let's say we have some bug in the code that we are trying to understand or debug

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,040
how this bug happened.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,520
So we don't know which code change actually caused that bug.

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,120
It could be something complex, so we don't know how to reproduce or how to find out

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,200
the cause or the issue.

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,000
So we are doing some testing.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,760
And let's say that the tester notices that since the changes of this commit, so from this

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,720
commit on or from this date on, the bug appeared and something isn't working.

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,480
So what we can do is in order to reproduce the issue, we can actually go back in time

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,080
and check out the commit using that hash.

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,320
And checking our commit means that we are going back to the version of the whole application,

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,520
so the whole code at the time of this commit.

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:48,000
So if I copy this and I can do git checkout commit hash, I have local changes so it doesn't

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,880
allow me to check out another commit.

21
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,960
So let's stash that and let's check out again.

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,020
And here you see I am in a detached head state.

23
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:10,480
This means that this is basically just information that tells me that I'm not in the most up-to-date

24
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,120
state of the branch.

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,240
I am somewhere in the previous state, some specific commit hash.

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,480
And what's interesting is that I can actually create a new branch based on the code version

27
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,040
that I had at this point in time.

28
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,920
So if I go back to my editor, I see that the whole application gets rearranged, maybe some

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,440
deleted files get reedited, maybe some current files get reverted so they're not shown in

30
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,800
the application anymore.

31
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,760
So I go back to a state of the application code that I had at the time of this commit.

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,280
If it was two months ago, then I go back to the code version two months ago.

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,480
And now I have a version of the code that I can use to replicate a bug that maybe happened

34
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,720
some time ago.

35
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,220
You also see that I'm not in the branch name anymore, but rather in a commit hash.

36
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,260
And as I said, you can do some changes from this version of the application and create

37
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,380
a branch based on that.

38
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:24,220
But this is not a very common scenario that you actually make changes in some previous

39
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,100
state of the application.

40
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:33,220
So mostly it's actually used for testing or to reproduce a bug that was maybe reported

41
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,900
for some time ago.

42
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,100
So now if I want to go back to the up-to-date state of the branch, then I can just do git

43
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,780
checkout the branch name.

44
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,880
And I'm at the head position.

45
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,980
Head in git basically means the top commit, so the latest commit state in the branch.
