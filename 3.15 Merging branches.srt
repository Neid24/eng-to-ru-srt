1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,580
Another git command is git merge that we can look into in this part.

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:17,580
So let's say that you have this bugfix branch that has been open for some days already and

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,420
a lot of things have been merged into master.

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,500
So you're way behind the master changes in your bugfix branch.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,220
And let's also say that changes from other branches, from other developers, are needed

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,500
so that you can test your bugfix in this branch.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,140
So what this means is that before you are done with fixing the bug here, you want to

8
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,680
merge the changes from the master to your branch.

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,120
So you want to pull the changes from the master branch to your bugfix branch.

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,940
So the way to do that is first of all make sure that your local master branch is up to

11
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,940
date.

12
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,300
So we pull all the changes.

13
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,900
So let's say two or three other branches have been merged to master and now we are trying

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,620
to merge that into our bugfix, right?

15
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,980
Now let's go back to our branch.

16
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:23,140
And the way to pull the changes from master in our bugfix branch is using git merge.

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:29,320
And with git merge, we need the parameter, which is the source where we are pulling the

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,280
code changes from.

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,480
So this here will take the changes from master branch, merge it into our bugfix branch.

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,400
This will create a new commit with merge branch master into bugfix.

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:57,100
And now if I do git log, you see the revert test commit from master is in our branch now.

22
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:04,020
And let's say I push that merge into the remote branch of bugfix.

23
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:11,220
Let's say I test my changes and it all works perfectly and I'm done fixing the bug.

24
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,560
So now I can actually create a pull request that can be merged into the master.

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,920
And here we see that there are a number of commits that are different from the master

26
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
branch.

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,240
So we can create a merge request from here.

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,880
We are going to delete the source branch when merge request is accepted.

29
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,440
And let's say someone reviews your code in the bugfix branch and everything looks fine.

30
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,780
And in this case, we are approving the pull request or the merge request.

31
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:51,100
And we're doing the git merge that I did here or that I showed here from the UI of GitLab.

32
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,060
So this is the same command that we executed on the command line.

33
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:05,580
So with merge, we are merging the bugfix branch back into the master.

34
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,000
So as you saw, you can do it either from UI or from command line.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,040
And you can merge any branch into any other branch.

36
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,440
But normal case or the standard case for this is either you are merging a master branch

37
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,680
into your feature branch or bugfix branch because you have that branch open for far

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,120
too long and you need the up to date changes because it has diverged too much or you are

39
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,320
done implementing your feature or you are done fixing your bug and now you're merging

40
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,500
it back to the master branch.

41
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,820
So these are the two cases where you need the merge command.

42
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:50,180
And if I go back to repository, we have one master branch and everything has been merged.

43
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,300
We have the git ignore, the ignored folders are also gone and all the changes from that

44
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,140
bugfix branch are here.
