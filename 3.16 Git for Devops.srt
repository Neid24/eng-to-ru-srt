1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now we saw use cases for how to use Git locally for development, how to execute different

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,120
commands, how to manage the Git repository and so on.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,960
Now the question is when or for which use cases you would need Git as a DevOps engineer.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,680
The first use case is when working with infrastructure as code concept.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,400
For example, if you are working with developer team that is deploying their application to

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,880
Kubernetes, for example, you would be probably responsible for creating various Kubernetes

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,200
configuration files and these files have to be managed somewhere, right?

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,480
So let's say you have files for creating volumes or deploying some databases.

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,720
Maybe you have your home charts for applications, so a lot of different configuration files

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,480
that you may need in Kubernetes.

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,720
In addition to that, let's say your Kubernetes cluster is deployed on AWS, right?

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,280
And in order to communicate with AWS and to manage the service on AWS, you don't do that

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,680
manually but rather use automation tools like Terraform and maybe also use Ansible for deployment.

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,240
And Terraform and Ansible configuration are also in form of configuration files.

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,400
And let's say in addition you have some scripts like some batch scripts and Python scripts

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,800
configured for various tasks. Now all of those are files that you probably change over time and

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,360
you also need some kind of tracking, some history of what has changed in those files,

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,240
but also some place where all of these files are stored securely in one place instead of

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,040
just laying around on your local computer, right? And that's only if you're working alone

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,760
as one person who is managing all this stuff. But usually you would probably be part of a DevOps

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,800
team where you have two, three, maybe even more DevOps engineers working and managing the same

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,560
infrastructure together. And that would mean that you would need some kind of collaboration to work

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,240
on the Terraform files on Ansible configuration files to write the scripts and so on. So just

24
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,760
like developers are working on the same code base and synchronizing and communicating with each other,

25
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,800
you as a DevOps team would need some kind of collaboration on those configuration files. So

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,200
you would use Git repository for that. So that's part of the infrastructure as code concept. So

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,640
you don't manually manage the infrastructure, but rather you write scripts or some automated

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,680
workflows to manage the infrastructure. And that is represented in files and code. And that is then

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:02,560
stored hosted on Git repositories. That's the first use case for why you would need Git as a DevOps

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,080
engineer. The second use case is when you are working with CI city pipeline, or generally a

31
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,040
build automation tool. So the basis of build automation or continuous integration continuous

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,400
delivery pipeline is that you check out the application code, you test it, you build the

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,240
application based on that code, and you do some other stuff with it. So this means that you need

34
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,320
integration of that build automation tool with the code, the application code Git repository,

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,080
and you also may need some Git commands specific for build automation tool. So to examine these

36
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,320
two points in more detail, you as a DevOps engineer may be responsible in some cases

37
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,600
to set up integration between the build automation tool and a Git repository. And

38
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,440
depending on the build automation tool, and depending on the Git repository, the integration may be

39
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,080
different. So having some kind of experience and understanding the concepts of how this integration

40
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,200
works is of course very important. And we're going to learn that, of course, in more detail and see

41
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,560
that in action in the build automation module. And another part that I mentioned is Git command

42
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,040
specific to build pipeline. And some of the examples of such commands can be, for example,

43
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,040
getting a commit hash of a specific commit, for example, the last commit, it could be, for example,

44
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:39,360
checking whether changes have happened in front end code or in back end code in order to decide

45
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,840
whether to run tests for that part, and so on. So these are some of the examples. And this is

46
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,680
for you to understand where you would need Git as a DevOps engineer. But as I mentioned,

47
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,760
we're going to see both scenarios using Git for Jenkins, CI CD pipeline and using Git repository

48
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,360
for infrastructures called tools in action in later modules.
