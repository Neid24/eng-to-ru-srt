1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Git is the most popular version control tools out there.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,160
As an alternative tool there is SVN for example but it's older and maybe used in some older

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,200
projects but Git is definitely the way to go in modern projects.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,600
Now how do you work with Git?

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,620
Git has multiple parts.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,520
It has the remote, Git repository, this is where the code lives and where everyone can

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,640
fetch the code or pull the code and push their own changes too.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,120
And this remote Git repository usually has UI so you can actually interact with this

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,200
code repository and do stuff with it through a user interface.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,140
It also has local Git repository.

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,880
This is where you keep your local copy of the remote repository code and this is where

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,240
your changes are saved and kept until you push them to the remote.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,100
It also has a history of the code changes.

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,640
This is a log, Git log.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,680
It has the staging part, this is basically where your working changes are saved.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,720
So whenever you deviate from the code that you just pulled from the remote repository

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,680
and you start making changes in your code, they are tracked by Git as current working

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,880
changes and later you can decide whether to commit them or basically revert the changes.

19
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,440
And finally you have Git client.

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:41,920
This could be again a user interface tool or could be a command line interface of Git.

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,320
And the client lets you execute Git commands to interact with the remote repository as

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,680
well as local repository.

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,800
So for example you can take your changes and commit them and push them to the remote repository.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,440
You can pull the new changes and so on.

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:07,000
These are all commands that you can execute using Git client that you will have to have

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,960
installed locally on your machine.
