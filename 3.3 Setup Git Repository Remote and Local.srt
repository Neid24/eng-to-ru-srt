1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,120
So, first of all, what is remote Git repository and how does it look like?

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,560
There are a couple of different Git repositories out there.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:18,200
There is GitHub, GitLab, they're both cloud repositories, they're hosted by the GitHub

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,880
and GitLab and you can create your own repositories and keep your code in there.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,760
So these are platforms that everybody can register on and host their repositories.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:36,960
However, companies do not host their code on some public cloud provider of Git repository,

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,360
but they have their own Git repositories hosted in the company on company servers, right?

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,800
So, alternatives for that is Bitbucket.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,880
You can also host GitLab locally on your own servers in the company and keep your code there.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,200
As a private developer, you can also host them on GitHub or GitLab

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,480
along with other repositories there.

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,960
One thing to note there is that when using GitHub or GitLab, for example, as your code repository,

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,200
you can decide whether to make it private or public.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,480
Usually, when you're developing a software application, if you're a startup, for example,

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,920
you don't want your code to be available and accessible to white public, right?

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,760
So you would want only you to have access to it and maybe your team members.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,920
So there are private repositories on those platforms and public repositories, right?

18
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,920
Public repositories are used for public libraries, for example, for different programming languages

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,920
or some open source projects.

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,720
As I mentioned, these repositories have UIs, user interface, and you can do a lot of stuff with the repository.

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,760
You can create, update, change files, etc.

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,440
You can give permissions, you can add users who will have access to the repository and so on.

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,720
You can do pretty much everything with it.

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,000
So this is how these repositories look like.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I have GitLab and GitHub.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,680
One thing to note here is that these organizations did not create the Git itself, right?

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:15,680
These are just repositories and the naming may sound like Git kind of belongs to them,

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
but it's actually a separate project.

29
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:26,000
So these are just repositories that emerged with a pretty powerful and pretty good user interface.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,400
So the first thing you need in order to use this publicly hosted GitLab and GitHub repositories is user accounts, right?

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,320
So no matter which one you choose, you can go just with one of them.

32
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,600
You have to create account.

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,520
I'm just going to sign in because I have an account.

34
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,600
And first of all, let's see on GitLab.

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,680
I already have a couple of repositories and here you see some of them are public.

36
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,640
These are things that I want others to have access to the whole public.

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,320
And there are some that are my own projects and I'm working on them myself.

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,320
So they're made private, only I can access those projects.

39
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:12,040
And creating a new repository is as easy as just clicking on create new project.

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,120
I'm going to name it My Project.

41
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,560
And in the project URL, we need to select a group or namespace.

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,360
You probably don't have any groups.

43
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,600
So don't worry about that.

44
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,000
You will see users with your account username.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,080
So that will be the namespace for this project.

46
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,280
So you can select that.

47
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,760
I'm going to select one of my groups, but it doesn't actually matter for this case.

48
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,600
And here I choose the private repository.

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,000
And for this test project, we will not create a readme file during creation.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,760
And the repository is ready.

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,720
And here you see the whole section where you can interact with the project, right?

52
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,240
I can create new files.

53
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,040
I can add a readme file.

54
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,120
I can set up continuous integration.

55
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,920
And I can do all sorts of things.

56
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,880
I can push my code to this remote repository and so on.

57
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,960
In the same way, it's pretty similar.

58
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,200
I can create a new repository just like that.

59
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,360
Private public repository name and create repository.

60
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,440
So very simple concept.

61
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,240
Those two UIs are also pretty similar.

62
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,480
So it doesn't really matter which one you choose for your own project.

63
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,960
In this case, we can actually go with GitLab because I have most of my projects here.

64
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,360
So I have my project repository created.

65
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,520
And now we have a remote repository.

66
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,960
Now, how do we get this repository locally?

67
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,200
So if I want to work in this, how do I access this remote repository from my machine?

68
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,520
The first thing is that you have to install Git Client.

69
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,480
It could be a UI tool.

70
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,000
Git Client, they're multiple out there.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,120
I personally use Git command line because it's very straightforward.

72
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,600
You have a handful of commands that you have to memorize and that's it.

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,440
And you can work pretty easily with that.

74
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,920
So depending on which operating system you're using, you can install Git command line on your machine.

75
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,000
Before we begin to work with Git via the command line, we can actually customize the terminal

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
so that it displays useful information such as what branch we are working on.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,200
To do this, we need to modify the shell configuration file already here on my machine using VIM.

78
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:43,040
If the file does not exist yet on your computer, you will need to create one using the touch command.

79
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,000
You just need to copy and paste the configuration found in the video description,

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,640
save your changes to the file and reload the terminal to have the same configuration as me.

81
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,160
So once you have customized the terminal and have the Git Client installed,

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,000
we can actually clone the repository.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,480
So the first time when you do not have a local copy of that remote repository,

84
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,640
you have to clone the repository.

85
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,120
And also very helpful, whenever you create a repository, either in GitLab or GitHub,

86
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
you actually get the whole instruction list of how to clone the repository,

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,120
how to fetch it locally and make it accessible, how to download and start working with it.

88
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,560
So the first command is git clone repository name.

89
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,080
And this is actually the repository name.

90
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,240
This is GitLab endpoint.

91
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,160
This is my username and this is the repository name.

92
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,360
However, before I can clone the repository and the repository on GitLab or GitHub,

93
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,320
I have to connect my Git Client with GitLab or GitHub.

94
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,320
And with connecting, I mean, I have to tell GitLab,

95
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,480
hey, I have an account on GitLab.

96
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,880
This is me as a user.

97
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,920
And I'm trying to connect from my machine using a Git Client.

98
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,040
So I have to authenticate, basically, to GitLab from the command line.

99
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:18,600
And the way to do that is by adding my SSH public key to GitLab.

100
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,040
And again, everything I configure here is exactly the same on GitHub.

101
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,840
So I'm just going to use GitLab as an example,

102
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,360
but know that everything works the same on GitHub.

103
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,160
In order to do that, I have to go to my user settings,

104
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,120
which I can find under my GitLab profile.

105
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:43,800
And in settings, I have SSH keys and I have to add my public SSH key here

106
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,960
so that Git can identify my client, so to say, where I'm sending the request to.

107
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,080
And then I'll have to authenticate.

108
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,760
And also, a very clear guide to an instruction to how to add that key to GitLab.

109
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,440
So we're going to do that next.

110
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,600
So first, if you already have that key,

111
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,680
you can check that actually in your home directory.ssh.

112
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,760
You can basically just copy it here and create the key.

113
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,360
Or if you don't have it, they also have an instruction guide

114
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,080
to how to generate that key.

115
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,600
And then you would copy that and add as a key, right?

116
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,240
So very descriptive, very easy to follow.

117
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,000
So first, let's do that.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,200
So this is going to be my public key.

119
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,720
And I can basically print it out and copy the output as a key.

120
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,520
So I can copy that output right here and just add the key.

121
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,080
And I already have added my key here.

122
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:52,720
So now I can access GitLab using my Git client.

123
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,960
So let's close that and actually clone the repository.

124
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,680
So I'm going to do it clone repository and it worked.

125
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,360
It's just a warning that I have an empty repository.

126
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,800
There is nothing there.

127
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:14,840
So if I do LS, I see that this folder got created,

128
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,360
which has the name of the project.

129
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,640
And if I go inside, so now this means

130
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:29,680
that I am in a local copy of that remote Git repository.

131
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,880
And let's actually see what's in there.

132
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,240
It's completely empty.

133
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,160
There is one thing that is inside the repository

134
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,840
and that is .git folder.

135
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,840
And .git basically has information about the repository itself.

136
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,840
It has information about the branches.

137
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,840
It has the history, the log, as I mentioned,

138
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,840
and it has the configuration endpoint, obviously, the remote endpoint

139
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
where this repository lives, and so on.

140
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,840
And this kind of stuff like who is the user and what is the user email

141
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,840
that is interacting with the Git repository and so on.

142
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,840
You can also execute these two config commands

143
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,840
to configure username and email globally for all your Git projects.

144
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,840
So every user that clones the repository locally

145
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,840
will have this .git folder

146
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,840
and they can actually configure whatever they want in this Git folder, right?

147
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,840
This is just for login.

148
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
In this Git folder, right?

149
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,840
This is just for local use, you can say.

150
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,840
So now because we have added our SSH key,

151
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,840
GitHub will be able to authenticate us whenever we pull

152
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,840
or push from the repository or we interact in some way

153
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,840
without having to provide username and password all the time.
