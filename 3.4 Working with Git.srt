1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
When working with files in Git, it's important to know the different status the file can

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,600
have and the status of the changes you make to code, to the application code.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:21,120
There are three stages such change, such a local change in the code goes through.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,920
If I create a new file or make changes in an existing file, then this change is going

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
to be in my working directory.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,160
And then I can later add those changes to a staging area.

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,920
And everything from the staging area can be committed to my local repository.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,040
So now what we can do is actually add some file.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,720
So I'm going to create a readme file.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,560
This is the standard.

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:56,760
And let's just write this is my new project doesn't really matter.

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,840
And now what I can do is I can do git status.

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,920
And this will tell me the status of my local git repository.

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,320
And in status, there's a bunch of information it will tell me which branch I'm on.

15
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:21,240
If I have any local changes that I should commit and add to the remote repository and

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
so on.

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Right.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,560
Now you may be thinking, why do I need to know what changes I have locally?

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,200
I just made a change.

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,720
So I would remember.

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,320
But usually what happens is if you're working on a task for a long time, for example, for

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,920
a couple of days, you come to work the next day, you probably want to be up to date to

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,560
what is the state of your local repository now, and it could be a bunch of files that

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
you have changed.

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,560
So you can see the status of that change using this command.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,440
And here you see the file that we created is under untracked files.

27
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,640
And we have a suggestion from git that we should add the file.

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
So what does it mean?

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,160
What this means is that this change will be promoted to a staging area with git add.

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,360
So basically git knows that there is a change, but it doesn't consider it as something that

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,360
will be merged or pushed back to the remote repository.

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,680
So it's like, we are just testing things out and we are not sure if this will end up

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,480
in the remote repository.

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,400
Now if at some point I think I would like to commit that change at the end, I can move

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,280
my changes to a staging area, or in other words, I can promote it to staging area closer

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,240
to being the end results.

37
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:46,080
And I can do that using git add, I can either take the file and add it directly.

38
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,400
If I have 50 files, for example, I don't want to copy each one of them, I can just do dot,

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,040
which means add every single file change that I have.

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,240
Now again, if you're working on some task locally and doing a bunch of different changes,

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,760
you may not want to commit all of those to the repository.

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,840
So you can decide to add just 10 files and leave the other 10 untracked, so to say.

43
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,360
So in this case, we're just going to add one file.

44
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,200
And now if I do get status, here you see it has become green, first of all.

45
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,560
It also says new files, so now git started tracking it so it knows it is a new file.

46
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,640
And instead of untracked files, now we have changes to be committed section.

47
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:40,560
So now what this means is that this file is ready to be committed and then pushed to the

48
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,000
remote repository.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:56,040
If I make another change to the read me

50
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,680
and do git status again, here you see I have one tracked file that is ready to be committed

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,320
and I have another one that is untracked.

52
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,480
And the best use case or usage for that is again, if I'm working on something complex

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,920
and complicated, I have made maybe 50 different changes, and I'm sure that 30 of those changes

54
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,800
will for sure end up in the repository, but I'm not sure about the 20 other changes.

55
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,760
I have to test them and I have to try out if they're really the correct changes.

56
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,720
So I can kind of separate those two sets of changes in my local repository.

57
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,760
So for example, I'm not sure about the second change here in read me, I just want this one

58
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,160
to be pushed in the repository.

59
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,880
And I'm going to continue working around and playing around with this.

60
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,480
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do git commit.

61
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,280
And this will take all the files that are in this section, changes to be committed,

62
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:08,280
right here, we'll ignore these ones, it will just take this and allow me to add some description

63
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:16,920
to what I did, I can say edit, read me file, because this is what I did.

64
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:24,600
And if I close my beam editor, you see a bunch of things.

65
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,360
Because of our terminal customization, you can see the current branch we are working

66
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,480
in, which is why main is shown here.

67
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:39,180
But what's important is here you see that file one file changed, and one insertion.

68
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:46,000
So now if I do git status, let's actually clear this up and do git status again.

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,440
And here you see that green line is gone, because I have committed it.

70
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,200
So I have something that I can push now to the remote repository.

71
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:04,920
Now if I do git log, this is what I told you about the history of the changes in git.

72
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,960
And I can see that history using git log.

73
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:15,880
And obviously this is showing me local history, because this change is not in the remote repository

74
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,400
yet.

75
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,040
This doesn't know about the change, right?

76
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,080
So this is just showing me the local repository history.

77
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:33,480
So now I can take and push what I have in the local repository to remote.

78
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,720
And I can do that using git push.

79
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,480
And again you see some feedback, output basically.

80
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:47,480
And if I go and refresh, you see I have one file, I have different project view, and I

81
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,280
have one file that I have edit with text.

82
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,080
Now others can also clone the repo and adding files and some code and working on it.
