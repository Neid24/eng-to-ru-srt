1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
Now, what if you already have a code locally?

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,080
Let's say you created some boilerplate code and you want to check it to get repository

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,160
instead of cloning an existing one.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:22,440
In that case, you can create a local repository in your code and then push that local repository

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,000
to the remote.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,880
And this can be a pretty legitimate use case, especially when you start working on a code

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,960
you develop stuff on your machine, especially if it's a private project.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,400
And at some point you decide to host it on GitLab or GitHub or some other Git repository.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:50,160
So now you need to move your existing code from your local machine to GitLab, for example.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,480
So let's actually see how that use case works.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,640
So I have a project locally that is not a Git repository, right?

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,240
I have some files there, I have the application code and so on.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:09,840
And if I do Git status here, here you see not a Git repository or any of the parent directories.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,000
So this basically means there is no dot Git folder in this project, something that we

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,600
have in here that contains the information about the remote Git repository about my Git

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,120
user and email and so on.

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:33,800
So we have to transform that project, this Node.js app project to local Git repository.

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,440
And we do that using Git init.

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:48,120
And here you see initialize empty Git repository and if I do A, I see dot Git was created.

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:56,080
So now if I do Git status, here I have a bunch of files that I can now commit.

21
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,600
And then push to a remote repository.

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:10,080
So I can do git add dot, this will add all the files that were marked red.

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:18,400
Here's the whole list and let's commit and say this is initial code, right?

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's clear that again and Git status will show us that there is nothing to commit.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,520
We have no changes, however we have local commit for the initial code.

26
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,640
And another change you probably also notice is that the moment that we transformed it

27
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,280
into a Git repository, a default branch name, the master branch name, got created and edit

28
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,240
here and we see that in the command line as well.

29
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:55,160
Now we have a local Git repository but it doesn't know anything about a remote repository.

30
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:02,160
So if I do git push here, basically it says no configuration for push destination.

31
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,960
So it doesn't know where to push this code to, it isn't connected to any remote repository.

32
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:17,280
So what we can do in this case is go back to our Git lab and create a new empty project

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,800
and let's call it some test node app, keep it private.

34
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,600
So now my local Git repository and this remote repository do not know anything about each

35
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,300
other so we have to connect them.

36
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,600
And the way to do that is actually also described here with this command.

37
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,960
So git remote, we already did the git init and git remote add origin, the address of

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,520
the repository.

39
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,360
And if I go back here, basically I have the same suggestion written here.

40
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,240
So it's very descriptive and they give very good instructions of how to do stuff.

41
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:01,920
So I'm just going to copy this command because it already has the name of our remote repository,

42
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,640
the endpoint of the remote repository in the command and I'm going to copy it here.

43
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:15,600
So what this does is basically tells my local Git repository where to push the changes to.

44
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,800
So it tells what the remote repository for this local repository should be.

45
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:29,080
And origin is the name of the destination and this is the URL of the destination.

46
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:38,520
And now if we do push, we see another error and this one says now it knows where the remote

47
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,760
repository is and how to connect to it, however now it cannot connect the branch, right?

48
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,840
It says the current branch master has no upstream branch.

49
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:57,080
So what this means is that now the repositories are connected, a remote repository is connected

50
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,840
to the remote, now we have to connect the branches.

51
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:07,200
Now we have to say master branch locally has to connect to the master branch on the remote

52
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,720
repository.

53
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,120
So we have to push the branch as well.

54
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:20,920
So if I do git push set upstream origin master, here we see branch master set up to track

55
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,000
remote branch master from origin.

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,640
So now they're connected and if I refresh this here, I see my whole code in the remote

57
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,840
repository.

58
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,080
And note that these changes that I just made here, git remote at origin and setting this

59
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:50,680
upstream of my master branch, this information actually got added to this dot git folder.

60
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,400
So this is where all of these gets configured.

61
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,440
And it stores the information about how to connect to the remote, where's the remote,

62
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,220
which endpoint and how the branches actually connect to each other.

63
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:11,860
If I deleted that dot git folder, then my project will not be a git repository anymore.

64
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,320
And I would have to connect or reconnect my local repository to the remote again.

65
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,640
So this has basically everything I need for that connection between the remote and local

66
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
repositories.

67
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,820
So if I decided that I don't want to host this project anymore, I want to delete that

68
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:36,320
from here, but I also want to delete any git configuration that I can basically just

69
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,920
remove this folder and that will be it.

70
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:47,160
So if I remove that, see, I don't have the branch name displayed here anymore.

71
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,560
If I do status, not a git repository.

72
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,140
So the connection is lost with the remote repository.
