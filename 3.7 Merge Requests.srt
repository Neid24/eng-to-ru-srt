00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,360
A common practice when working on code with Git is that when developer is done with feature

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,820
implementation or bug fix, other developer reviews the changes until merging it to master.

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,720
Because we said master has to be protected.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:27,640
It has to be in the state that everyone knows is tested and can be deployed anytime to production

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,340
and has no half implemented or broken things inside as much as possible.

6
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:39,320
Most common use cases is when feature implementation required a lot of code changes, or maybe you

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,040
have a junior developer in the team, or maybe backend developer changed something in the

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,560
frontend code or vice versa, you have developers helping and checking each other's code, right?

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,360
So maybe a senior developer checks the code of the junior developer until it gets merged

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,360
to master, or the frontend developer or expert checks that the backend developer made the

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,080
changes in frontend in a correct way.

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,200
And if not, it's a great chance for developers to learn and grow from each other and from

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,020
each other's expertise.

14
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,560
So they can actually suggest how it should be done better, or maybe find a major mistake

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,240
themselves and tell the other developer how they should improve the code, or maybe write

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,400
the code in a cleaner way.

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,880
And of course, it makes sure the code stays clean.

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,340
And no major mistakes get merged to the master branch.

19
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,520
So there's some validation before adding changes to master branch.

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,400
And the way to do that is using pull requests.

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,680
And this is a very simple concept.

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,720
For example, so let's say I'm working on my feature branch, and I have just completed

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,480
the implementation, the database connection is done, and everything works.

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,200
I have tested it locally, and I think that it's ready.

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,800
So now it should be time to merge it to master, right?

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,960
So in order to do that, I'm going to create a pull request that some other developer in

27
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:17,760
my team maybe with more experience in doing the database connection can review and approve

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,960
that it can be merged into master.

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,200
So the way to do that is go back and go to branches.

30
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,540
Along the feature branch here, I see a merge request.

31
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,320
And here I see that there is one change or one commit in this feature branch that is

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,360
different from the master, right?

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,640
So let's say if I did another change, let's again change some small thing here.

34
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,560
It doesn't really matter what I change.

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:03:00,360
Just want to do a new commit.

36
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:08,320
And now if I push the changes and I refresh here, I see two commits.

37
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,960
So there are two changes in this feature branch that aren't in master.

38
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,360
So this need to be merged, so to say.

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,600
So what is the first one, the first number here?

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,200
These are the changes that master has that my feature branch doesn't have, right?

41
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,960
Because obviously it can happen that another developer is ready with the bug fix.

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,760
They merge their changes into master, but I don't have them yet, right?

43
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,960
So now the master branch has changes that my feature branch doesn't have and the other

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,320
way around as well.

45
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,000
My feature branch has changes that master doesn't have.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,280
In order to create the pull request or the merge request, it is actually named differently

47
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,960
in different repositories, so it could be called either merge request or pull request.

48
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,360
So in GitLab, it's merge request.

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,600
So if I click on that, here you see the feature branch will be merged to master branch, which

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,280
is exactly what we want.

51
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,040
Here we can add the title or description of what the branch actually includes.

52
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,480
And then you can assign it to one of the developers in the team for approval.

53
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,920
You can also select someone as a reviewer for your code here as well, or you can leave

54
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,640
both of them unassigned.

55
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,840
So the way it works is that you may know that someone in the team has expertise exactly

56
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,720
in the area that you have worked on, so you can assign it to that person.

57
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,400
Or if you think that anybody can review the code and you can leave it unassigned and submit

58
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,600
merge request.

59
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
And now another developer will see your merge request and will see the changes that you

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
have made.

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,920
You will see the commits, maybe, separately.

62
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,160
Again, there are different UIs.

63
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,960
For this, it looks differently in Bitbucket, for example, or in GitHub.

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,040
But there are two things you can do once a merge request has been assigned to you.

65
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,520
The first one is to approve or decline the merge request.

66
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,240
For example, if you find there's something wrong with these changes, for example, you

67
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,000
don't think this is a correct change, then you can add some comments.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,280
Basically as a reviewer, you don't change the stuff here and fix the issues yourself.

69
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,720
You leave comments, so the person who implemented this can actually learn from this.

70
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,480
So that's the actual idea behind it.

71
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,480
So the person who made those mistakes can learn from them and you basically give them

72
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,040
some suggestions and inputs.

73
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,760
So in that case, you can actually reject the merge request, then the developer will go

74
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:45,360
back and do the changes based on your suggestion and then create a pull request again.

75
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,080
And once it looks fine, you can approve it and you can also merge it.

76
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:58,280
So if I click merge, the changes were merged in master.

77
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:08,640
If I go back to the repository, here you see the changes are in master, which means the

78
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,920
merge is complete.
