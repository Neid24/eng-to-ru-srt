1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
Another thing to note here is that there are two options for dealing with the branch once

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,920
it's merged into master, right?

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,160
Either we can leave the branch in case someone finds a bug or we have to add something in

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,360
the feature branch so we can leave that.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,440
So in case we need to do some other changes in the branch later, or we can delete that

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,920
right after merging it.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,880
Again, there are best practices for that and which one to choose.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,520
Usually a lot of teams, they leave the branches and then clean up at some point later.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,520
However, the better option is to delete the branches when they are merged.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,840
And if there's some bugs that emerge from that or something isn't really working, then

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,080
you can create a new branch, a bug fix branch, for example, to fix that issue.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,440
If something needs to be added or some addition needs to be done to that feature, then create

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,360
a new branch for that as well.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,360
And the advantage is that you don't end up with hundreds of branches where nobody knows

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,880
which one is active, which one is completed, or even which one is merged into another branch.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,120
By deleting the branch, you can avoid this confusion that will arise if you don't delete

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,440
the branch right away.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,720
So if I go to branches, I can see the list of all the branches here.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,120
Master one is protected so no one can delete that, but I can delete one of the feature

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,760
branches or even one of the bug fix branches completely from the remote repository.

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,000
The branch has been deleted in the remote repository.

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,000
However, I still have it locally.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,320
So if I do git branch, I see my local branch and I'm actually still on it.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,480
And if I do git status here, I stay in the branch and I can actually do some more changes

25
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,040
in the branch.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,440
So it's my job, so to say, my responsibility to clean up the branches that has been deleted

27
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,360
remotely locally, right?

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:19,920
So if I do git pull, I get actually information from remote that my configuration that references

29
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,720
a remote branch with the same name doesn't work anymore or isn't valid anymore because

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,000
there is no such reference remotely.

31
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,080
And the way to delete the branches locally that have been deleted on the remote repository

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:44,840
is first we're going to go to master and then do git pull because some changes have been made.

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,760
So we have to pull that merge basically because the master branch changed.

34
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:59,240
Now we have those changes locally and we do that using it branch minus D and the name

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,400
of that branch.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,480
And now if I do git branch, you see that local branch got deleted as well.

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,200
I just have master and bug fix locally and master and bug fix remotely.
