1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
Now, let's consider another case where we are working in a branch, let's say, in our

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:30,960
bugfix branch, and we make some changes in here, let's go with readme again. So, so

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,680
we make a change in readme. And let's say another developer is also working in the same

4
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,080
branch together with us, right? So they make some changes in the same branch. Let's go

5
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:53,080
to branch here. So I'm going to go to maybe app, and server.js, and change some thing

6
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:09,440
here, edit. And maybe I want some other log. log entry for testing. And I can commit those

7
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,920
changes to the branch. So now what happened is that my local repository doesn't know about

8
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,400
those changes. And repository or local repository of another developer doesn't know about my

9
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:33,800
changes. So now what happens if I want to add and commit my change, and push it, adjusted

10
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:45,680
something again. Right. So what happens, let's clear this up. What happens if I do it push?

11
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,280
You see, it says you can't push your changes because there are some other changes that

12
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,560
have been already pushed to the remote branch. So first I need to do git pull before I can

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:07,560
push my changes. So if I do git pull, what happened is that git pull basically pulls

14
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:15,040
the changes locally and creates a new commit that the remote branch got merged into my

15
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:23,600
local branch, right? So I can save it. And now if I push, if I do git push, I'm actually

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:31,200
pushing two commits. One was my commit and another one was this merge commit. So if I

17
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:39,440
refresh, and I'm in this bug fix branch, here I see adjusted something again. And so let's

18
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,880
say this was another user, adjusted something again, and merge branch commit. Now another

19
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,480
best practice with git is that imagine if you have to do that all the time, let's say

20
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,520
you are merging something into master and obviously there are some other developers who have

21
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:05,400
made some changes. So you have to pull those changes first. So it is actually pretty inconvenient

22
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,480
to have all those merge commits in your history because all they represent is basically that

23
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,280
you pulled the changes before you could push it, right? And there is a way to avoid those

24
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,120
merge branch commits every time we get the changes from the remote branch. And the way

25
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:33,040
to do that is using git pull rebase. So instead of git pull, we do git pull rebase. So what

26
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,680
that does is basically pulls the changes from remote branch. And then it stacks our changes

27
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,440
or our commit on top of that. So there is no merge branch commit in between. So we can

28
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:54,640
see that in action again, let's do our famous change in the read me, blah, blah, doesn't

29
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:11,480
really matter. And before we push that, we're going to back to files. And let's save the

30
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:20,120
server js again, for rebase. So we're going to commit this one first. So now remote branch

31
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,480
has something that we don't have locally. So we have to pull that. Right. So again,

32
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,800
let's try to do push. It says no, you can do that, you have to do git pull. And instead

33
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:40,920
of git pull, we're going to do git pull rebase. Right. So you see, the new commit didn't happen,

34
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:48,280
the merge commits. And here we see that our own commit basically got stacked on top. So

35
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,520
if I do git log, which is the history of the changes, I see the update server js with

36
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,920
the something that I just did as the first commit. And on top of that, this is our commit.

37
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:13,840
So now if I do git push and refresh, here you see update server, this is from developer

38
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,480
one. And this is my commit. There is no merge branch commit. So you can avoid this unnecessary

39
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,920
commits actually using rebase.
