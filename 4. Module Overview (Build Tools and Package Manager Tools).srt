1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
In this module, you will learn about build tools and package manager tools.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,800
These are technologies that are used in software development process and as part of the application

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,760
building process something that DevOps engineers should also understand.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,100
So we will look at what role these tools have in software development process and how to

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,320
use them.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,380
This is going to be a general overview and comparison of these technologies and not a

7
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,020
deep dive into any of these tools.

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,780
However, to showcase the comparison and different concepts, we will see specific examples with

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,460
two popular programming languages.

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:50,180
For Java, we will use Gradle and Maven and for JavaScript, we will look at NPM.

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:56,120
So we will learn how to build and package Java and then JavaScript applications into

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,580
artifacts using these tools as well as how to add and install application dependencies

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,940
and so on.

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,220
So we will see some common shared concepts of these tools as well as the main differences

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:09,980
between them.
