1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
What are build and package manager tools?

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,200
Say you are a group of developers writing an application for your startup or maybe a

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,600
project in a big company.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,840
When you're done implementing your application, the application must be made available for

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,400
the end users, right?

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,660
So it needs to be deployed, meaning the application that you developed and is living in a code

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,300
repository must somehow end up on a production server and run there.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,980
So how do you deploy a software application?

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,860
Meaning how do you move your code and its dependencies and everything needs to run to

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,460
a server where the application will run.

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,620
So it's accessible for end users.

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,700
It could be a production server or staging server.

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:58,340
Well you package your application in a single movable file and then you can get that file

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,220
to a server and run it there.

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:08,260
So you can move around that file and that single packaged file is called application artifact.

16
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,420
Packaging the application also called building the code of the application into a singular

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:19,700
artifact that you can move around and deploy or install on servers.

18
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,180
And that will involve compiling the code of the application, compressing the code from

19
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,900
hundreds of files into one file because you can't move around hundreds of files and also

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,440
make it smaller so that it's not too huge and slow to move around.

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,380
So after artifact is built, we don't just directly copy it to the server but rather

22
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,580
we keep it also in a storage.

23
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,300
In case we needed multiple times.

24
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,420
For example, if we deploy the artifact on a development server then we're gonna need

25
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,780
to deploy that same artifact on a test environment and later maybe on a production environment.

26
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,500
Or maybe that development server where we started the artifact, where we copied the artifact

27
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:14,940
directly crashes so we need the backup of that artifact to deploy it again.

28
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,860
And also you may need to give access to that artifact to testers so that they maybe can

29
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,100
run it locally and test it there.

30
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,260
So it could be a lot of different use cases.

31
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:34,340
And that storage where we keep the artifact once we build it is called artifact repository.

32
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,540
Examples of artifact repositories are Nexus or JFrog artifactory, etc.

33
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,460
So every time you release a new version of your application or you want to make a new

34
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:53,120
version available for testers to test before the release, you create an artifact, you save

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,700
it in the artifact repository and deploy it on the server.

36
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,500
Now you probably are wondering what these artifacts look like.

37
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,060
What kind of file formats do they have?

38
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,920
Is it a zip file?

39
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,980
Maybe some other special type?

40
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,860
And what is inside that artifact?

41
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,980
Well depending on the programming language you use for your application, this packaging

42
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,220
or this artifact file will look different.

43
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:28,180
For example, if you have a Java application, the artifact file will be a jar or war file.

44
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,260
AR stands for Java Archive, where AR stands for Archive.

45
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,020
And it will include the whole code plus the dependencies your code uses, like Spring libraries,

46
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,900
some daytime libraries, maybe PDF processor, etc.

47
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,700
So basically everything your application code needs to run.
