1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Before we move on to the demos, we will need to install a couple of tools.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,600
And we're going to install them together step by step in the next lectures.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,720
We will use build tools to build a Java application.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,600
So first we're going to install Java, then we're going to install Maven which is a build

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,280
tool for Java applications.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:30,200
After that we will install Gradle which is an alternative build tool for Java applications.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,840
And finally we will build a JavaScript application.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,440
So we're going to need to install NPM and Node.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,320
Also important to have a good code editor to work with.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,080
We're going to be using IntelliJ which is great and makes it easy to set up and run

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,700
your applications, especially Java applications.

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,840
So we're going to install that as well.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,240
And as I said we're going to install all these tools and configure them step by step

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,920
together in the next demo videos.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,400
Now the installation is going to differ based on your operating system.

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,000
So I created separate installation guides for Windows and macOS.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,240
Linux is similar to macOS so you can watch the respective video for your operating system.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,880
Also note that installing different tools on servers on different operating systems

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,040
is something that DevOps engineer would have to do very often.

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,520
So being comfortable with it and knowing how to install things on operating system is a

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,720
skill in itself.
