1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Since many of you may have Windows machines, I also made a video for showing some useful

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,040
concepts and examples, like a brief overview of how Windows file system and command line

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,680
differs from Linux or generally Unix-like systems.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,640
As well as show you how to install different tools, we're going to need in the bootcamp

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,240
on a Windows operating system.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,880
So first of all, as I explained, Windows file system has multiple roots, not just one,

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,000
which are called drives.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,480
Within those drives, however, you have the same hierarchy of files and folders.

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,680
In Windows, also unlike Unix systems, not everything is a file with just a different

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:59,320
type, but rather its own thing like a device or a driver or a folder, so these things are

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,160
not represented as files.

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,960
Also note that we use backward slashes in Windows for paths of directories, instead of forward

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,960
slashes in Unix-like systems.

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,720
Another big difference is that compared to Unix, applications aren't split and distributed

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,440
into different directories when installing them.

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,840
Yet all the application files are installed in one place or one folder, mostly under C-Drive

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,400
program files directory.

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,120
As for the command line, we have mostly different commands on Windows because Windows uses different

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,880
shell programs.

20
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,520
For example, dear command is used for displaying directory contents, and even though CD command

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,280
is the same here as well, almost all other Linux commands are not available in Windows.

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,760
So on Windows, you have to learn completely new commands for doing the same stuff.

23
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,880
And as a result, Windows scripts also have a different syntax, obviously.

24
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,480
Generally note that Windows operating system was originally optimized and still is more

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,680
optimized for graphical user interface and not so much for the command line interface.

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,760
So Windows CLI isn't so much fun to work with.

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,480
To work around this, however, you can download and configure various terminal applications

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,520
where you can use more Unix-like commands to work properly with the command line.

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,680
Now let's actually install and configure some software on Windows operating system, which

30
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,320
you will need for the bootcamp.

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,680
Now in the build tools module, throughout all the videos that you're going to see, we're

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,200
going to be using a couple of technologies and couple of projects in order to learn different

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,560
build tools.

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,960
And to use those technologies, obviously, you first have to install them, to set them

35
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,680
up, to install them, and to get them ready to work.

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
And that's exactly what I'm going to show you in this video, how to install all of these

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
tools.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,560
So first of all, we're going to set up IntelliJ IDE, Integrated Development Environment.

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,040
So this is going to be your code editor.

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,760
This is going to be a place where you open all your projects and also run commands.

41
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Once we have set up IntelliJ, we're going to install Java, Maven, and see how to open

42
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,320
a Java Maven project in IntelliJ and how to run it.

43
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,960
And after that, we're going to set up a Java grader project in IntelliJ.

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:42,000
And finally, we're going to install NodeJS and NPM on a Windows machine.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,240
Now I'm going to be using a virtual machine of Windows, which is hosted on my Mac.

46
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,160
So you will see that the quality is not very sharp and also it may be a little bit slow.

47
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,440
And that's the reason for that.

48
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,920
But other than that, everything else should be fine.

49
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,220
So this is a Windows 10.

50
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,840
But most of the stuff that I'm going to explain to you is general Windows knowledge and how

51
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,560
to install different tools on Windows.

52
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:20,520
So with that, let's just dive in and start by installing IntelliJ on our Windows machine.

53
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,520
I'm just going to go to a browser.

54
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,840
I'm just using all the defaults.

55
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,860
I haven't configured any new browser or anything yet here.

56
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,720
So we're just going to type in IntelliJ download.

57
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,000
And this is basically where you can download IntelliJ from.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,100
And we're going to go with the community version, which is free.

59
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,100
And this is going to be just enough for all our projects and all our needs.

60
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,300
So go ahead and download community version.

61
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,500
It's going to take some time.

62
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,740
So we're going to wait until that downloads.

63
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,100
So the executable was downloaded.

64
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,540
So I'm going to go to the folder in the downloads.

65
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,020
And I'm just going to double click on it.

66
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,740
I'm going to allow the access.

67
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,420
And this is basically an installation wizard.

68
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,180
So we're just going to do next.

69
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,940
So that's the destination of where the application will be installed.

70
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:25,740
We're going to leave that at default and next, next, and just install it.

71
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,140
And once the installation is completed, we're going to see IntelliJ starting up.

72
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:39,700
And we have a fresh new screen where there are no projects.

73
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,260
And we can start by creating a new project in IntelliJ.

74
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:50,060
Or if you have a project already downloaded from Git, or GitLab, or GitHub, whatever you

75
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,580
have your code, you can open it using this button here.

76
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:00,260
Or you can also fetch it directly from a Git repository, which is what I'm going to do here.

77
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:06,660
So I'm going to basically get the code directly using IntelliJ in my editor from my GitLab

78
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,660
account.

79
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,420
So I'm going to click on this.

80
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:16,700
And also, if you don't have Git locally, it will show you here a link saying download

81
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
Git.

82
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:23,020
So you can basically just click on it and IntelliJ will take care of it in the background.

83
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,380
And this is going to be a URL of my Git project.

84
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:32,900
And these are going to be the exact same projects that you are going to use in the next videos

85
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,420
in this build tools module.

86
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:41,140
So here I'm going to show you how to set up an import and open each one of them in IntelliJ.

87
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,420
So the first one is going to be the Java Maven project.

88
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,700
And I'm going to paste in the GitLab URL for the project, which you can find in the lecture

89
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,060
description.

90
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:58,100
Once it is correctly entered, I'm going to click clone.

91
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:05,420
And this will start basically fetching the repository from GitLab to my Windows machine.

92
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,860
And once it's fully fetched, it's going to then open it in IntelliJ editor.

93
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,700
And I'm going to do trust project.

94
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,420
And as you see here, it automatically opens the project.

95
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:29,900
And then you're going to see what actually happens in IntelliJ once the project is opened.

96
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,620
And this is basically our project.

97
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,300
And as you see right here, it says resolving Maven dependencies.

98
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,040
So basically IntelliJ already detected that this is a Java Maven project, and it also

99
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:50,540
saw that there is a pom.xml file with dependencies inside.

100
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:56,500
And it basically starts downloading all the dependencies and basically just setting up

101
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,700
your project inside IntelliJ.

102
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,740
So you don't have to take any action, it will take care of all of these for you.

103
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,500
And as you saw, the project structure basically got created.

104
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,580
And that's why you see a different view now.

105
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,480
You have this project folder here.

106
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,280
And if I expand this, you have a nice source folder.

107
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,960
So everything is basically now structured in a proper Maven project, right?

108
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,920
So IntelliJ basically detected it's a Maven project and did all the necessary stuff to

109
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,800
render it as a Maven project.

110
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,880
And you don't have to understand any of these files yet and what the pom.xml is and what

111
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,520
the dependencies are.

112
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,380
I'm going to cover that in the later videos of build tools.

113
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:49,380
Right now just concentrate and focus on opening this project in your IntelliJ editor and getting

114
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,540
the project up and running.

115
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,260
And you see that it's still downloading some plugins.

116
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,340
So we're going to need to wait until all of that is done.

117
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:06,620
So as you see, everything was installed, there is no activity right here.

118
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,600
And also in IntelliJ, you have everything really nicely integrated, right?

119
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,840
So because it's a Maven project, IntelliJ also gives you the corresponding Maven tab

120
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
here.

121
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:27,080
So if I click on it, it will actually expand and show me the Maven plugins, the Maven dependencies.

122
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,240
So basically a different structure of the application with the proper view.

123
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,580
Now again, this is something that IntelliJ does for you depending on which build tool

124
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,580
you're using.

125
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,620
So that's actually very helpful.

126
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:46,900
And if you want to refresh your state, redownload everything or basically just refresh the Maven,

127
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,420
you can also click on this button here.

128
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,820
So that means that everything is set from IntelliJ site.

129
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:07,000
And now I'm going to go to my source and actually open up my application.java file.

130
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,880
And as you see here, once it actually rendered everything, it shows me in red color that

131
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,200
all of these things are actually not defined, right?

132
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,560
And it says also here project JDK is not defined.

133
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,740
And that basically means that it cannot resolve any of those words because it's written in

134
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,460
Java and there is no Java available on my Windows machine at the moment, right?

135
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:40,180
So IntelliJ does not know how to resolve them because there is no JDK or Java development

136
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,980
kit that IntelliJ can find.

137
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:51,920
And if I click here on setup SDK, I have a shortcut of what action I can take.

138
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,320
And also I can show you another place where you can actually see all the project settings,

139
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,160
including whether Java is defined for the project.

140
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:11,000
So in file, project structure, you see right here, no SDK, right?

141
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:17,340
You don't have to understand exactly now what SDK means and how all this works, because

142
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:23,180
this is actually mostly part of developers work and how developers actually set up their

143
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,180
projects.

144
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,100
So you as a DevOps engineer do not have to have a deep knowledge in that.

145
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:35,100
However, just to give you an idea, since the project is written in Java, we have to install

146
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,700
Java locally so that the application can run, right?

147
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,920
This is a Java application and it needs Java to run it.

148
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,880
And that's basically where the SDK comes from because we need a Java software development

149
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,400
kit that's a JDK for Java right here.

150
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,560
So there are two parts here.

151
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,440
You need Java to run your application once you wrote it.

152
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:08,160
And SDK is basically Java software development kit that helps you develop in Java language.

153
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,300
And that's exactly what you have to configure for your project.

154
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,140
So because we don't have that installed on our machine, IntelliJ doesn't know how to

155
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:23,340
find it or where to find it, and therefore it cannot resolve any of these Java functions

156
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,500
and Java classes, etc.

157
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,540
And that's why we need to add a JDK here.

158
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:36,900
And in IntelliJ, actually, you have a shortcut for downloading JDK, right?

159
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:42,640
Which is right here, download JDK, and it will basically in the background do it for

160
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
you.

161
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,400
Alternatively, you can download JDK yourself.

162
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,360
You can go on a website of Oracle JDK and then basically just install it.

163
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,640
I'm just going to click on download JDK because it's a convenient shortcut way to do that.

164
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,880
And we're going to wait for that to finish.

165
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,920
In this dialog box, you have to choose the version of Java you want to install.

166
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,460
And we're not going to choose the latest version.

167
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,060
And the reason for that is because later, we're going to be working with Java Gradle

168
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:20,660
application and the latest Java version is not compatible with Gradle version yet.

169
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,060
So we will specify a different version here.

170
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:30,140
We can leave the vendor as Amazon, and this is the location where it's going to be downloaded

171
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,140
into.

172
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,100
So I'm going to click on download.

173
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,240
And again, in IntelliJ, you have this installing or downloading, et cetera, progress bars right

174
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
here.

175
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,960
So you can check that something is basically executing in the background.

176
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,600
So let's wait for that to install.

177
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,480
So installation is completed.

178
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,120
And right here, you see that Java is selected.

179
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,520
And I'm going to do apply and OK.

180
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,380
And now let's give it a couple of seconds, actually, because you see scanning files to

181
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:10,300
index and all these red color actually should disappear.

182
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,260
And the moment the indexing was complete, all the red color disappeared.

183
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:23,260
And here you see basically all the Java classes and basically Java syntax is working again,

184
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,260
right?

185
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,460
Because there is a JDK installed and set up for this project in the background.

186
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:34,480
So IntelliJ uses that JDK to basically resolve everything that you write here in Java.

187
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,840
Again, you don't have to understand this code.

188
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,160
You're just going to be using it to build the application, but you're not going to be

189
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,200
writing any code in here.

190
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:51,440
And now that we have installed Java and it's configured for the project and for IntelliJ,

191
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,080
we can actually run our application.

192
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,040
So right here, you see this green triangle.

193
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,380
So if I click here, it says run application.main.

194
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,740
So if I click, this will actually execute this application.

195
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,940
And we're going to see the results of that run in the console in a second.

196
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,140
Again, we see a progress here that it's building the application before it can run it.

197
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:26,140
And here we have a pop-up of the application logs.

198
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,580
Right here, this is run tab.

199
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:35,320
So whenever you run application, it actually starts in this special tab, which is called

200
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,040
run.

201
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,780
And here we see that our application started and we have some application logs here, right?

202
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,400
So everything looks good.

203
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,760
We can start our application in IntelliJ.

204
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,400
That's already great.

205
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,180
And if you want to stop your application, you can either right here or right here, you

206
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:08,600
can actually stop the application using this red square and it will terminate the application.

207
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,180
Another really useful feature of IntelliJ is that it provides you with a terminal, a

208
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,220
command line interface within the editor.

209
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:24,320
So here you have this terminal tab and it can be configured so that we can run the exact

210
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,320
same commands here in IntelliJ as we do in the command line interface.

211
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,400
If the default IntelliJ terminal uses Windows PowerShell like mine does here, we can just

212
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,920
update IntelliJ settings.

213
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:51,860
If you click file and settings and then under tools, terminal, change the selection to cmd.x

214
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,380
or executable and then apply the change.

215
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:06,140
And after I restart the terminal, it will actually give me a proper command line interface

216
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:12,400
just like this one right here and I can type any commands here.

217
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,200
And now since we installed Java, we should be able to run Java commands on our machine,

218
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
right?

219
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:26,120
However, if I type in Java here and execute, it says that Java is not recognized as a command

220
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,400
because when I execute it, it doesn't know where Java executable is actually located,

221
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
right?

222
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Even though we have it installed locally.

223
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,060
It means that if I want to execute Java now with this configuration, I would have to go

224
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:45,060
to the location where Java was installed by IntelliJ, which is in this folder here under

225
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,460
my users directory.

226
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:56,220
And inside that folder, there is bin or binary, Java binary executable and inside that there

227
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,220
is Java.

228
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,060
So that's actually now a full path to Java command.

229
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:07,960
So if I want to execute a Java command now, let's say print out the version and execute.

230
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,640
And here you see the open JDK version.

231
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,360
So that's how we can actually execute Java now, however, obviously that's inconvenient.

232
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,800
And if you want to be able to execute Java without specifying the full path, right, just

233
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:31,700
like this, in Windows, you actually have to specifically set location of the executable

234
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,340
of whatever command you want to execute, right?

235
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:39,900
So for Java, we want to tell Windows, hey, whenever I type Java here, I want you to know

236
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,580
that the executable for that command is actually at this location, right?

237
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,220
So now Windows will know how to execute it.

238
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,520
And that is actually going to be very useful to know for a lot of technologies.

239
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,280
And we're going to use that multiple times in this video.

240
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,440
And to do that, it's actually pretty easy.

241
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:09,280
In the search bar here, I'm going to type in advanced system settings, which opens a

242
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,680
dialogue directly with environment variables.

243
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,740
And the environment variables are split into user variables and system variables.

244
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,780
So these are my user specific environment variables, which other users basically don't

245
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,720
see or doesn't interfere with other users' variable on the same machine.

246
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,140
And they're variables, environment variables, system-wide.

247
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:40,060
So these are basically something that is set on the whole machine and every user will

248
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,700
have access to them.

249
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,720
And one of those system variables is called path.

250
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,760
And this is actually locations, so a list of locations of different technologies and

251
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,200
different commands that Windows will know how to execute without specifying the full

252
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,760
location or full path all the time.

253
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,400
And that's where we're going to add our Java executable location as well.

254
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,640
So I'm going to mark this, I'm going to select the path, and then I'm going to click edit.

255
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,900
And here you see a nice view with the list of all the locations.

256
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,220
And I'm just going to add a new one.

257
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:26,780
And the new one is going to be the full path, I'm going to select it here, the full path

258
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,100
to bin location, right, to the bin folder.

259
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,420
And going back here, that's new, I'm just going to paste it here, right?

260
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:42,920
So again, very important, it's not the open JDK location is actually the binary folder

261
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
location, right?

262
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:51,360
This is the folder where Java.exe file or Java executable file is located.

263
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,080
And I'm going to click OK.

264
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,560
So the path will be edit and click OK here as well.

265
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,920
And note that for this to actually take effect, we need to restart our session.

266
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,940
So in the same session, if I do Java, it's still unrecognized, right?

267
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:17,060
However, if I open a new terminal from here, for example, and if I do Java here, you see

268
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,580
that command is available.

269
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:27,140
And also if I want to print out the path variable, you see that this path is appended there,

270
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,140
right?

271
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,020
So it's part of the path.

272
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,660
And that means if we want to make it available in IntelliJ also, we need to restart IntelliJ.

273
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:44,560
Because just simply starting a new terminal session here does not help.

274
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,320
And that's why I'm just going to restart IntelliJ.

275
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:57,640
Close window, exit, and once reopened, I'm just going to do Java here and the command

276
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,040
should be available.

277
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Awesome.

278
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,560
So we have successfully run our Java application in the IntelliJ.

279
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:11,980
We have set Java executable path inside our Windows machine so that we can execute it

280
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,620
with simple Java command.

281
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,220
Now as a next step, we want to install Maven.

282
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,580
So we have Maven commands available to build our application.

283
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:30,740
And Maven is actually written in Java and is mostly used for building Java applications.

284
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,980
And because of that, the prerequisite of Maven is also Java SDK, right?

285
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,500
Which we have installed already.

286
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,900
So that one prerequisite is fulfilled.

287
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:49,320
Another prerequisite is having Java executable in the path because behind the scenes Maven

288
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,360
uses the Java commands.

289
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,620
And that's what we set with the path environment variable.

290
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,320
So that one is done as well.

291
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,480
And the third thing we need to set for Maven is another environment variable called Java

292
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Home.

293
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,120
And we have to set that also before we install Maven.

294
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:14,520
And the same way we did it, I'm going to go to advanced system settings, environment

295
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,800
variables.

296
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:21,640
And right here we are going to add a new environment variable because it's not there yet.

297
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,040
And the system variables, so I'm going to do new.

298
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,480
And this is going to be called Java Home.

299
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,760
And note that this is the name of environment variable.

300
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,120
You can't call it something else.

301
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:42,760
And the value of that is actually the location of the open JDK without the bin folder, right?

302
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,480
That's the only difference here.

303
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,160
So I'm going to paste it in.

304
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,040
So this is the open JDK folder, not the slash bin.

305
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,480
And that is the location of Java Home, right?

306
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,380
That's where the variable Java Home points to.

307
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,960
So I'm going to save this.

308
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,520
And let's actually leave this if we need that later.

309
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:13,160
And again, right now, if I do Java Home, it's not going to show the value because we need

310
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,960
to restart the whole session.

311
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,760
So if I close this, and because I don't want to restart IntelliJ, again, I'm going to do

312
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,960
it in the command line terminal.

313
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,800
So again, Java Home.

314
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,920
And there you go.

315
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,840
So this one is set as well.

316
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,720
So now we are ready to install Maven, which is actually pretty easy.
